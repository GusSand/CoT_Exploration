TITLE: CT0 Mechanistic Analysis - Passive Hub with Cascading Divergence
DATE: 2025-10-29
PARTICIPANTS: User, Claude (Developer role)
SUMMARY: Conducted three experiments establishing CT0 as a passive information hub that encodes question info. When attention to CT0 is blocked, reasoning diverges immediately at CT1 (30%) and cascades through the chain (62% by CT4). Key finding: intermediate CT tokens change, not just final answers.

INITIAL PROMPT: when the machine rebooted we were doing some CT0 analysis on Llama1B in regards to its attention. Can we continue with that?

KEY DECISIONS:
- Decided to run bidirectional blocking experiment (11_ct0_bidirectional_blocking.py) to test if CT0 is passive hub vs active coordinator
- Result: CT0 is PASSIVE HUB (input blocking = 0% drop, output blocking = 16% drop)
- Decided to analyze attention flow patterns to identify who writes TO CT0 and who reads FROM CT0
- Result: CT0 reads from question (100%), CT1-CT5 read from CT0 (3-5% attention each)
- User asked critical question: "Does only the final answer change, or do the preliminary decodings of the continuous chain of thought positions change?"
- Decided to create hidden state divergence analysis (13_analyze_ct_hidden_state_divergence.py)
- Result: Intermediate CT tokens DO change - CT1 30% diverged, cascading to 62% by CT4
- Decided to document all findings according to CLAUDE.md guidelines before proceeding to qualitative case studies

## Detailed Conversation Flow

### Context Recovery
- Machine rebooted during CT0 attention analysis
- Checked existing files to understand prior work:
  - `docs/experiments/10-29_llama_gsm8k_ct0_case_studies.md` - Previous case studies showing CT0 causes calculation errors
  - `src/experiments/codi_attention_flow/ablation/11_ct0_bidirectional_blocking.py` - Script for testing CT0's role
  - Existing attention data in `results/attention_data/` directory

### Experiment 1: Bidirectional Blocking
- **Goal**: Test if CT0 is passive hub or active coordinator
- **Method**: Block attention TO CT0 (output), FROM CT0 (input), or both
- **Issue**: Disk space full (100% used)
- **User action**: User fixed disk space
- **Result**:
  - Output blocked: -16% accuracy drop (58% → 42%)
  - Input blocked: 0% accuracy drop (58% → 58%)
  - Conclusion: CT0 is PASSIVE HUB (doesn't need input, others need its output)

### Experiment 2: CT0 Writers and Readers
- **Goal**: Identify information flow patterns
- **Method**: Analyze baseline attention weights across all CT steps
- **Technical issues**:
  - Missing h5py dependency → installed
  - Path issues → fixed
  - Attention tensor shape misunderstanding → corrected (query_len=1 during generation)
- **Result**:
  - CT0 → Question: 100% attention (step 0 only)
  - CT1-CT5 → CT0: 3-5% attention each (decreasing pattern)
  - Complete flow: Question → CT0 (encodes) → CT1-CT5 (read) → Answer

### Critical User Question
**User**: "I want to understand what happens with the attention to CT0. Does only the final answer change, or do the preliminary decodings of the continuous chain of thought positions change?"

- User correctly identified that we only blocked attention, not hidden states
- Hidden states still flow through residual stream
- Key question: Do intermediate CT tokens diverge, or only final answer?

### Experiment 3: Hidden State Divergence
- **Goal**: Track when and how reasoning diverges when CT0 attention blocked
- **Method**: Compute cosine similarity between baseline and CT0-blocked hidden states for CT0-CT5
- **Technical issue**: numpy float32 not JSON serializable → added type conversion
- **Result**:
  - **CT0**: 1.00 similarity (identical - as expected)
  - **CT1**: 0.70 similarity (30% diverged IMMEDIATELY!)
  - **CT2**: 0.54 similarity (cascading)
  - **CT3**: 0.47 similarity
  - **CT4**: 0.38 similarity (62% diverged - most diverged)
  - **CT5**: 0.52 similarity (slight recovery)
  - **Pattern**: Accumulating divergence (-9.8% per step)

### Key Insight
- Answer to user's question: **Intermediate CT tokens DO change, not just final answer**
- Divergence starts immediately at CT1 and cascades through the chain
- CT0 blocking affects the ENTIRE reasoning process, not just final answer generation

### Documentation Phase
**User**: "But before that can we document everything according to claude.md"
- Updated research journal with high-level summary
- Created comprehensive experiment documentation (10-29_llama_gsm8k_ct0_mechanistic_analysis.md)
- Verified DATA_INVENTORY.md didn't need updates (used existing data)
- Saved this conversation
- Next step: Commit to git

3. ⏭️ Create qualitative case studies showing step-by-step divergence examples

### Future Work
- Layer-specific divergence analysis (which layers diverge most?)
- Hidden state zeroing (stronger intervention than attention blocking)
- CT1-CT5 interdependence analysis (do they read from each other?)
- Cross-dataset validation (MMLU, CommonsenseQA)
- Semantic decoding (what does each CT token represent?)

## Research Impact

This work provides the first mechanistic explanation for CT0's critical role in CODI:

1. **CT0 as Question Cache**: Encodes question info once, serves as passive storage
2. **Attention-Mediated Access**: Later tokens must read via attention (residual stream insufficient)
3. **Sequential Dependency**: Each CT token depends on accessing CT0's encoding
4. **Cascading Failures**: Early divergence amplifies through dependent steps

Explains both CODI's efficiency (centralized encoding) and vulnerability (single point of failure).
