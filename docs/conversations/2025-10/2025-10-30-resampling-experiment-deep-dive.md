## Qualitative Examples

### Example 1: The Crab Problem (Problem A)

**Question:**
> "Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, who has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. If Bo has 40 crabs, calculate the total number of crabs the three have together."

**Manual Solution:**
1. Bo = 40 crabs
2. Monic = Bo - 4 = 40 - 4 = **36 crabs**
3. Rani = Monic + 10 = 36 + 10 = **46 crabs**
4. Total = 40 + 36 + 46 = **122 crabs**

**Gold Answer:** 122
**Baseline Prediction:** 122 ✓ (correct!)

**CT Token Decoding Results:**

```
CT0: [':', '70', '68', ':\\n', '72'] - Generic formatting
CT1: ['36', '036', '336', '35', '936'] - 36 with 99.3% confidence (Monic's count!)
CT2: ['36', '036', '34', 'uni', '236'] - Still 36 with 97.3% confidence
CT3: [',', ' (', 'unos', '_,', 'pen'] - Only operators and punctuation
CT4: ['46', '446', '346', 'unted', '47'] - 46 with 99.3% confidence (Rani's count!)
CT5: ['46', '36', 'uni', '>>', 'oir'] - 46 with 82.3% confidence
```

**Smoking Gun Evidence:**
- CT1 literally encodes "36" (Monic's crab count) with 99.3% certainty
- CT4 literally encodes "46" (Rani's crab count) with 99.3% certainty
- CT3 contains NO numbers - only generic operators (",", "(", etc.)

### Example 2: The Duck Problem (Problem B)

**Question:**
> "Ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects each week to survive. If there is a flock of ten ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day?"

**Manual Solution:**
1. Per week: 10 ducks × 3.5 lbs = **35 lbs per week**
2. Per day: 35 lbs ÷ 7 days = **5 lbs per day**

**Gold Answer:** 5
**Baseline Prediction:** 5 ✓ (correct!)

**CT Token Decoding Results:**

```
CT0: ['35', '<<', '*', '33', '['] - 35 with 99.2% confidence (the weekly total!)
CT1: ['35', '45', '25', '55', '-'] - 35 with 99.1% confidence
CT4: ['35', '10', '105', '3', 'BREAK'] - 35 with 98.8% confidence
CT5: ['35', '-', '.', 'ish', '>>'] - 35 with 94.1% confidence
```

**Smoking Gun Evidence:**
- CT0 encodes "35" (3.5×10) with 99.2% confidence
- Multiple CT tokens encode this intermediate calculation result
- The final answer "5" appears in CT0's top-5 predictions!

### Example 3: The Contamination Experiment

**Setup:**
- **Problem A (Crab):** Gold = 122, Baseline = 122
- **Problem B (Duck):** Gold = 5, Baseline = 5

**What We Did:**
We swapped CT4 from Problem B (duck problem) into Problem A (crab problem).

**Step-by-Step:**

```
Normal Execution (Problem A):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Input: "Rani has ten more..."   │
│ CT0: Setup computation           │
│ CT1: "36" (Monic's count)        │
│ CT2: "36" (verify)               │
│ CT3: "," (operator)              │
│ CT4: "46" (Rani's count) ← KEY! │
│ CT5: "46" (verify)               │
│ Output: "122" ✓                  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

Contaminated Execution (Swapping CT4):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ Input: "Rani has ten more..."   │
│ CT0: Setup computation           │
│ CT1: "36" (Monic's count)        │
│ CT2: "36" (verify)               │
│ CT3: "," (operator)              │
│ CT4: "35" (FROM DUCK PROBLEM!) ← SWAPPED!
│ CT5: Tries to recover...        │
│ Output: "111" ✗                  │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Result:**
- Original answer: 122
- Contaminated answer: 111
- **Impact:** 14.6% contamination (answer changed!)

**Why 111?**
The model probably tried to compute: 40 + 36 + 35 = 111
(Using the contaminated "35" instead of the correct "46")

### Example 4: Why CT3 Shows the Paradox

**CT3 Ablation Test:**
```
Normal (with CT3):
Input → CT0 → CT1 → CT2 → CT3 → CT4 → CT5 → Output
Accuracy: 85.0%

Ablated (skip CT3):
Input → CT0 → CT1 → CT2 → [SKIP] → CT4 → CT5 → Output
Accuracy: 70.0%

Impact: -15.0% (significant!)
```

**CT3 Resampling Test:**
```
Normal (Problem A):
Input → CT0 → CT1 → CT2 → CT3(",") → CT4 → CT5 → Output: 122

Contaminated (swap CT3 from Problem B):
Input → CT0 → CT1 → CT2 → CT3(">>") → CT4 → CT5 → Output: 122

Impact: -3.0% (minimal!)
```

**Why the Paradox?**

**CT3 decodes to:**
- Problem A: `[',', ' (', 'unos', '_,', 'pen']` - operators only
- Problem B: `['>>', ',', '>', 'c', '!']` - operators only

**Interpretation:**
- **Ablation high (15%):** Removing the operator position breaks the computation pipeline
  - Like removing the "+" from "40 + 36 + 46"
  - The structure is broken

- **Resampling low (3%):** Swapping operators doesn't change the calculation
  - Like changing "40 + 36 + 46" to "40 >> 36 >> 46"
  - The model ignores the incorrect operator and recovers

**The Smoking Gun:**
CT3 contains ONLY punctuation/operators, NO numbers. It's structurally necessary (pipeline position) but informationally empty (no problem-specific content).

## Conceptual Understanding: Ablation vs Resampling

### The Core Distinction

**Ablation = Absence**
- "What happens if this position doesn't exist at all?"
- Tests: **Necessity** (Is this position required?)

**Resampling = Wrong Information**
- "What happens if this position contains information from a different problem?"
- Tests: **Specificity** (Does this position contain problem-specific information?)

### Analogy 1: The Recipe

**Ablation:**
```
Original recipe: "Mix flour, eggs, sugar. Bake at 350°F."
Ablated: "Mix flour, eggs, sugar. Bake at [MISSING]."
Result: You can't bake - you don't know the temperature!
```

**Resampling:**
```
Original recipe: "Mix flour, eggs, sugar. Bake at 350°F."
Contaminated: "Mix flour, eggs, sugar. Bake at 450°F." (from pizza recipe)
Result: You can still bake, but your cake will burn!
```

### Analogy 2: The Calculator Display

**Ablation:**
```
Calculator: 40 + 36 + [DISPLAY MISSING]
You: "I can't see the intermediate result!"
Impact: High (can't continue calculation)
```

**Resampling:**
```
Calculator: 40 + 36 + [DISPLAY SHOWS 35 INSTEAD OF 46]
You: "I can see a number, but it's wrong!"
Impact: Depends on when you catch the error
```

### Analogy 3: GPS Navigation

**Ablation:**
```
GPS: "Start at [NO DATA]. Turn right. Destination ahead."
You: Lost - no starting position at all
Impact: Can't navigate
```

**Resampling:**
```
GPS: "Start at [WRONG ADDRESS]. Turn right. Destination ahead."
You: Confused - wrong starting position
Impact: Might still reach destination if you correct course
```

### Why They're Orthogonal

**Four Possible Combinations:**

1. **High Ablation + High Resampling** (CT2: 14.6%, 16.9%)
   - Necessary AND problem-specific
   - Example: Critical intermediate calculation result
   - Removing breaks pipeline, contaminating changes answer

2. **High Ablation + Low Resampling** (CT3: 15.0%, 3.0%)
   - Necessary BUT generic
   - Example: Operator token (",", ">>")
   - Removing breaks pipeline, but swapping operators doesn't matter
   - **THE PARADOX!**

3. **Low Ablation + High Resampling** (CT4: 3.5%, 14.6%)
   - Redundant BUT problem-specific
   - Example: Late-stage calculation that model can recover without
   - Can skip position, but wrong number contaminates answer

4. **Low Ablation + Low Resampling** (rare)
   - Redundant AND generic
   - Example: Filler tokens with no computational role

## Critical Implementation Details

### How Ablation Works (NOT Zeroing!)

**CORRECT (what we do):**
```python
for step in range(6):
    if step == 4:  # Ablate CT4
        continue  # Skip this generation entirely

    # Generate CT token normally
    outputs = model.codi(...)
```

**INCORRECT (what user thought):**
```python
for step in range(6):
    if step == 4:  # Try to ablate CT4
        latent_embd = torch.zeros_like(latent_embd)  # WRONG!

    # This still generates CT4, just with zeros - NOT ablation!
    outputs = model.codi(...)
```

**Why the distinction matters:**
- **Ablation (skip):** Model sees positions [0,1,2,3,5] - position 4 doesn't exist
- **Zeroing:** Model sees positions [0,1,2,3,4,5] - position 4 exists but is all zeros

**Impact difference:**
- **Skipping:** "I don't have a temperature for this recipe"
- **Zeroing:** "The temperature is 0 degrees" (nonsensical but present)

### How CT Token Decoding Works

**Location: `/home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration/src/experiments/10-30_llama_gsm8k_resampling_validation/scripts/7_smoking_gun_test.py:32-69`**

```python
def decode_ct_token(model, tokenizer, ct_hidden_state, top_k=10):
    """
    Decode a CT token's hidden state to see what tokens it's "thinking about".
    """
    # Get the LM head (output projection)
    lm_head = model.codi.get_output_embeddings()

    # Project hidden state to vocabulary logits
    with torch.no_grad():
        hidden = ct_hidden_state.unsqueeze(0).to(device)
        logits = lm_head(hidden)  # [1, vocab_size]

        # Get probabilities
        probs = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)

        # Get top-k tokens
        top_probs, top_indices = torch.topk(probs[0], k=top_k)

        # Decode tokens
        tokens = [tokenizer.decode([idx.item()]) for idx in top_indices]
        probs_list = top_probs.cpu().tolist()

    return {
        'tokens': tokens,
        'probabilities': probs_list,
        'top_token': tokens[0],
        'top_prob': probs_list[0]
    }
```

**Key points:**
- CT hidden states are extracted from **final layer (layer 15 of 16)**
- Extracted at the end of each autoregressive CT generation step
- Projected through LM head (same as normal token generation)
- Returns vocabulary distribution (what the model would generate next)

**Why this works:**
- CT tokens are in the same representation space as regular tokens
- The LM head projects from hidden space (2048-dim) to vocabulary space (128K tokens)
- Top probability token shows what the CT "represents" in token space

## Connection to Attention Analysis

### CT0 as Attention Hub

**From: `/home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration/docs/experiments/10-29_attention_analysis_summary_and_next_steps.md`**

**Finding:** CT0 receives 0.197 incoming attention (1.18× baseline of 0.167)

**Visualization:**
```
Attention Flow:
Question tokens → → → CT0 (HUB) → → → [CT1, CT2, CT3, CT4, CT5]
                 ↑↑↑              ↓↓↓
             0.197 in-degree    redistributes
```

**Ablation experiment:**
- **Normal accuracy:** 85.95%
- **CT0 ablated:** 70.71%
- **Impact:** -15.24% (massive!)

**Three dimensions framework:**

| Position | Attention Centrality | Content Specificity | Pipeline Position | Ablation | Resampling |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|-------------------|----------|------------|
| CT0 | Hub (0.197 in-degree) | "35" (99.2%) | Early | 18.7% | 10.3% |
| CT1 | Moderate | "36" (99.3%) | Early-mid | 12.8% | 14.6% |
| CT2 | Moderate | "36" (97.3%) | Mid | 14.6% | 16.9% |
| CT3 | Connector | Operators only | Mid | 15.0% | 3.0% |
| CT4 | Peripheral | "46" (99.3%) | Late | 3.5% | 14.6% |
| CT5 | Moderate | "46" (82.3%) | Late | 26.0% | 14.9% |

**Why CT0 shows high ablation but moderate resampling:**

1. **High ablation (18.7%):**
   - CT0 is the attention hub
   - Removing it breaks the attention architecture
   - Later tokens can't access aggregated information
   - Like removing a central server in a network

2. **Moderate resampling (10.3%):**
   - CT0 is contaminated with wrong number ("35" from duck vs "70" from crab)
   - BUT it's early in the pipeline
   - Later tokens (CT1-CT5) can detect and correct the error
   - Like GPS giving wrong starting position - you can reroute

**The three-dimensional insight:**
- **Attention centrality:** Determines ablation impact (removing hub = high impact)
- **Content specificity:** Determines resampling impact (wrong content = contamination)
- **Pipeline position:** Modulates resampling impact (early = recoverable, late = critical)

---

## Key Insights to Remember

### 1. The Smoking Gun
CT tokens literally encode intermediate arithmetic results with 99%+ confidence. This is not a vague representation - it's explicit calculation storage.

### 2. The CT3 Paradox
A position can be structurally necessary (high ablation) without containing problem-specific information (low resampling). CT3 proves this by containing only operators.

### 3. Orthogonal Dimensions
Necessity and specificity are independent properties (r = -0.065). You can't predict resampling impact from ablation impact.

### 4. Ablation ≠ Zeroing
Ablation means skipping token generation entirely, not setting values to zero. This is critical for understanding why ablation impact is different from contamination impact.

### 5. Early Recovery
Early-stage contamination (CT0, CT1) can be recovered by later tokens. Late-stage contamination (CT4, CT5) is harder to fix because there's less computation remaining.

### 6. Three Dimensions
Understanding CT token behavior requires considering:
- Attention centrality (hub vs peripheral)
- Content specificity (numbers vs operators)
- Pipeline position (early vs late)

### 7. Error Types
- **Absence (ablation):** "I don't have this information" → Model can compensate
- **Wrong information (resampling):** "I have incorrect information" → Model may trust and propagate error
