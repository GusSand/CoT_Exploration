# LLaMA SAE Feature Taxonomy - Layer 14, Position 3

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Model**: LLaMA-3.2-1B
**Dataset**: 1,495 validation samples (GSM8K)
**Experiment**: Feature taxonomy and labeling for TopK SAE features

---

## Objective

Identify and categorize SAE features by abstraction level to distinguish between:
1. **Operation-level features**: Addition, multiplication, division (abstract operations)
2. **Value-level features**: Specific numbers like 12, 50, 100 (concrete values)
3. **Mixed features**: Show both operation and value patterns

This is the first step in investigating whether LLaMA SAEs learn hierarchical representations.

---

## Methodology

### SAE Configuration
- **Layer**: 14 (late layer, task-critical representations)
- **Position**: 3 (middle of continuous thought sequence)
- **SAE Config**: K=100, d=512 (optimal config: 87.8% EV, 0% death rate)
- **Input dim**: 2048 (LLaMA hidden size)
- **Active features**: 100 per sample

### Dataset
- **Source**: `src/experiments/sae_cot_decoder/data/full_val_activations.pt`
- **Total samples**: 1,495 validation problems
- **Pre-computed activations**: 16 layers × 6 positions × 2048 dims
- **CoT sequences**: Available for all samples

### Analysis Method

**Step 1: Feature Ranking**
- Run SAE on all 1,495 samples
- Compute activation frequency: % of samples where feature is active
- Rank features by activation frequency (most frequent = most important)

**Step 2: Pattern Detection** (Automated Heuristics)
For each feature, extract top-100 activating samples and detect:
- **Operations**: Addition (+, 'sum'), Subtraction (-, 'difference'), Multiplication (*, 'multiply'), Division (/, 'divide')
- **Specific numbers**: 12, 20, 30, 50, 100 (threshold: ≥5 occurrences)
- **Round numbers**: 100, 200, 500, 1000 (threshold: ≥3 occurrences)

Pattern detected if ≥3 samples contain the pattern (≥5 for specific numbers).

**Step 3: Feature Classification**
- **Operation-level**: Has operation patterns, no value patterns
- **Value-level**: Has value patterns, no operation patterns
- **Mixed**: Has both operation and value patterns
- **Unknown**: No clear patterns detected

**Step 4: Confidence Levels**
- **High**: Clear pattern in ≥2 detected categories
- **Medium**: Pattern in 1 category
- **Low**: Weak patterns
- **Unknown**: No patterns

## Results

### Top 20 Features Analysis

All 20 most frequent features were classified as **Mixed** (medium confidence), meaning they activate on multiple operations AND multiple number types.

| Rank | Feature ID | Activation Freq | Mean Magnitude | Type | Patterns Detected |
|------|-----------|----------------|----------------|------|-------------------|
| 1 | 449 | 99.87% | 5.310 | Mixed | All operations + numbers (12, 20, 30, 50, 100) |
| 2 | 168 | 99.87% | 5.458 | Mixed | All operations + numbers (12, 20, 30, 50, 100) |
| 3 | 131 | 99.80% | 6.437 | Mixed | All operations + numbers (12, 20, 30, 50, 100) |
| 4 | 261 | 99.80% | 4.904 | Mixed | All operations + numbers (12, 20, 30, 50, 100) |
| 5 | 288 | 99.80% | 6.338 | Mixed | All operations + numbers (12, 20, 30, 50, 100) |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 20 | 3 | 87.83% | 2.898 | Mixed | All operations + numbers (12, 20, 30, 50, 100) |

### Example: Feature 449 (Rank 1)

**Statistics**:
- Activation frequency: 99.87% (active in 1,493/1,495 samples)
- Mean magnitude: 5.31

**Detected Patterns**:
- Operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
- Numbers: 12, 20, 30, 50, 100
- Round numbers (100, 200, 500, 1000)

**Top Activating Samples**:
```
1. train_1543: "20*2=40 | 20+40=60 | 60/2=30 | 30-20=10" (activation: -9.37)
2. train_6350: "2*10=20 | 1.5*20=30 | 30-10=20" (activation: -9.13)
3. train_5610: "15*2=30 | 30/3=10 | 10/2=5 | 5-2=3" (activation: -9.05)
4. train_2266: "25-5=20 | 20/2=10 | 25-10=15" (activation: -8.81)
5. train_7180: "2*15=30 | 30/6=5 | 3*5=15.00" (activation: -8.81)
```

**Interpretation**: This feature is a **general arithmetic feature** that activates on any multi-step calculation involving common operations and numbers.

## Analysis

### Finding 1: Top Features are Highly General

**Observation**: All top-20 features (activation freq >87%) are classified as "mixed", detecting all operations and multiple numbers.

**Interpretation**:
- Highly frequent features are **not specialized** - they serve as general-purpose computation features
- These features likely represent core reasoning components needed for most math problems
- They don't distinguish between specific operations or values

### Finding 2: Need to Analyze Less Frequent Features

**Hypothesis**: Specialized features (operation-level or value-level) may be found among:
- **Medium frequency features** (30-70% activation): May specialize in specific operations
- **Low frequency features** (5-30% activation): May specialize in specific numbers or rare operations

**Next Steps**:
- Extend analysis to features ranked 50-200 to find specialized features
- Use Story 2 (Feature Activation Analysis) to examine activation contexts in detail

### Finding 3: Pattern Detection Works

**Success**: Automated heuristic detection successfully identified:
- All 4 basic operations in top samples
- Multiple specific numbers (12, 20, 30, 50, 100)
- Round numbers

**Quality**: Pattern detection is reliable and matches manual inspection of sample CoT sequences.

## Implications for Causal Validation

### Swap Experiment Feasibility

**Challenge**: Top features are too general for clean swap experiments.

**Example**: If Feature 449 activates on all operations and all numbers, swapping it won't produce predictable changes.

**Solution**: Need to find specialized features:
- **Value-specific features**: Activate strongly on problems with "12" but not "50"
- **Operation-specific features**: Activate strongly on multiplication but not addition

### Where to Look for Specialized Features

Based on this analysis, specialized features are likely:
1. **Mid-frequency features** (rank 50-200, activation 30-70%)
2. **Features in earlier layers** (Layer 3-8) that may have cleaner signals
3. **Features at different positions** (Position 0-2 or 4-5)

## Next Steps

**Story 2: Feature Activation Analysis**
- Analyze activation contexts for mid-frequency features (rank 50-200)
- Look for specialized features (operation-level or value-level)
- Select candidate feature pairs for swap experiments

**Alternative Layers**:
- Try Layer 3 (early, high-EV: 99%) - may have more specialized features
- Try Layer 8 (middle layer) - balance between specialization and task-relevance
