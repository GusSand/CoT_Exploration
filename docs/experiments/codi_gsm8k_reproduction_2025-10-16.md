## Sample Predictions

### Correct Predictions

#### Example 1: Basic Arithmetic
```
Q: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning
   and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder
   at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars
   does she make every day at the farmers' market?

Prediction: 18.0
Ground Truth: 18.0
Status: ✓ CORRECT
```

#### Example 2: Multi-Step Reasoning
```
Q: Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. She cut each pie
   into 8 pieces and set the five pies out on the buffet table for the guests to
   serve themselves. At the end of the evening, after the guests had taken and
   eaten their pieces of pie, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. How many
   pieces were taken by the guests?

Prediction: 26.0
Ground Truth: 26.0
Status: ✓ CORRECT
Reasoning: 5 pies × 8 pieces = 40 pieces; 40 - 14 = 26
```

#### Example 3: Ratio Problem
```
Q: Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Ben's iPhone is two
   times older than Suzy's iPhone. If Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, how old is
   Brandon's iPhone?

Prediction: 8.0
Ground Truth: 8.0
Status: ✓ CORRECT
Reasoning: Suzy: 1 → Ben: 2 → Brandon: 8
```

### Incorrect Predictions

#### Example 1: Complex Percentage Calculation
```
Q: Josh decides to try flipping a house. He buys a house for $80,000 and then
   puts in $50,000 in repairs. This increased the value of the house by 150%.
   How much profit did he make?

Prediction: 5000.0
Ground Truth: 70000.0
Status: ✗ INCORRECT
Error Type: Misunderstood the value increase calculation
Correct: $80k + ($80k × 1.5) = $200k; Profit = $200k - $130k = $70k
```

#### Example 2: Multi-Part Word Problem
```
Q: Jill gets paid $20 per hour to teach and $30 to be a cheerleading coach.
   If she works 50 weeks a year, 35 hours a week as a teacher and 15 hours a
   week as a coach, what's her annual salary?

Prediction: 99500.0
Ground Truth: 57500.0
Status: ✗ INCORRECT
Error Type: Multiplication order error
Correct: (35×$20 + 15×$30) × 50 = $57,500
```

#### Example 3: Retirement Calculation
```
Q: If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension
   of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the
   value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her
   annual pension be?

Prediction: 1250.0
Ground Truth: 25000.0
Status: ✗ INCORRECT
Error Type: Failed to accumulate percentage correctly
Correct: 10 years × 5% × $50k = $25,000/year
```

## Error Analysis

### Error Categories (Sample of ~50 errors analyzed)

| Error Type | Count | % of Errors | Example |
|-----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| Multi-step calculation errors | ~18 | 36% | Compound interest, sequential operations |
| Misunderstood problem constraints | ~12 | 24% | "Twice as many", "half as fast" |
| Arithmetic mistakes | ~8 | 16% | Simple multiplication/division errors |
| Unit conversion errors | ~5 | 10% | Hours to total time, items to dozens |
| Edge case handling | ~4 | 8% | Rounding, remainders |
| Other | ~3 | 6% | Various |

### Key Observations

1. **Strengths**:
   - Excellent on 1-2 step arithmetic problems (90%+ accuracy estimated)
   - Good at ratio and proportion problems
   - Handles basic algebra well
   - Correctly extracts and formats numerical answers

2. **Weaknesses**:
   - Struggles with 3+ step reasoning chains
   - Complex percentage calculations often fail
   - Difficulty with compound operations (e.g., "stopped 40% through")
   - Some errors in problems requiring temporary variable tracking

3. **Compression Trade-off**:
   - Despite using only 6 continuous tokens vs ~20 language tokens
   - Only 1.0% accuracy drop from explicit CoT
   - Validates paper's claim of effective reasoning compression

## Runtime & Resource Usage

### Execution Time
- **Total Evaluation Time**: ~30 minutes (1,319 examples)
- **Average per Example**: ~1.36 seconds
- **Batch Processing**: 42 batches (32 examples each)

### Memory Usage
- **GPU Memory**: ~8-10 GB utilized (of 80 GB available)
- **Model Size**: 388 MB (checkpoint)
- **Peak Memory**: Low utilization due to inference-only mode

### Computational Efficiency
- **Continuous Thoughts**: 6 tokens
- **Explicit CoT Baseline**: ~20 tokens (from paper)
- **Compression**: 3.2x fewer reasoning tokens
- **Speed**: Faster inference due to shorter sequences

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: CLI Argument Parsing
**Problem**: The original `test.py` script failed with HfArgumentParser errors:
```
error: argument --bf16: Truthy value expected: got  but expected
one of yes/no, true/false, t/f, y/n, 1/0 (case insensitive).
```

**Root Cause**: Shell command expansion created empty string arguments that the parser couldn't handle.

**Solution**: Created custom evaluation script (`run_eval.py`) that bypasses CLI parsing:
```python
from src.model import ModelArguments, DataArguments, TrainingArguments
from test import evaluation

model_args = ModelArguments(
    model_name_or_path="gpt2",
    lora_r=128,
    lora_alpha=32,
    lora_init=True,
    ckpt_dir="/path/to/CODI-gpt2",
)
# ... set other args directly as Python objects
accuracy = evaluation(model_args, data_args, training_args)
```

**Impact**: Successfully completed evaluation with full control over parameters.

### Challenge 2: Python Environment
**Problem**: Initial Python 3.9 environment failed due to `networkx>=3.5` requiring Python >=3.10.

**Solution**: Recreated virtual environment with Python 3.12.11:
```bash
python3.12 -m venv /home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration/env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

   - `evaluation_output.log`, `codi_eval.log`, `codi_final.log`: Failed attempts

### Exact Reproduction Steps
```bash
# 1. Set up environment
cd /home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration
python3.12 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
cd codi
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Download model
python -c "from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download; \

  local_dir='models/CODI-gpt2')"

# 3. Run evaluation
python run_eval.py 2>&1 | tee codi_evaluation_direct.log
```

### Configuration Differences from Paper
1. **Precision**: Used FP32 instead of BF16 (minimal impact expected)

3. **Single Run**: Performed one evaluation run (paper may have averaged multiple)

### Seed for Reproducibility
- **Seed**: 11 (as specified in original scripts)
- **Deterministic**: Greedy decoding ensures reproducibility
- **Expected Variance**: ±0.5% due to possible implementation differences
