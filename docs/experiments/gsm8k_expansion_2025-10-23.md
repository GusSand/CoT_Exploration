# GSM8K CoT Dataset Expansion - October 23, 2025

## Executive Summary

**Objective**: Expand LLaMA CoT-needed dataset from 132 to 1,000-1,500 problems with stratified difficulty distribution.

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS (Testing 7,500 problems, ETA: ~90 minutes)

**Key Achievement**: Built end-to-end pipeline that tests CoT necessity 40× faster than initially estimated (1.5 hours vs 40 hours).

**Impact**: Will enable robust statistical analysis across difficulty levels and support systematic ablation studies on problems requiring latent reasoning.

---

## Motivation

### Problem

Current dataset of **132 original GSM8K problems** where LLaMA needs CoT is insufficient for desired experimental design:

**Current Distribution**:
- 2-step: 42 problems (need ≥150)
- 3-step: 37 problems (need ≥150)
- 4-step: 32 problems (need ≥100)
- 5+ step: 21 problems (need ≥50)

**Gaps**:
- 2-step: Need 108 more (+257%)
- 3-step: Need 113 more (+305%)
- 4-step: Need 68 more (+212%)
- 5+step: Need 29 more (+138%)

### Requirements

User specified target distribution:
```
2-step problems: n ≥ 150
3-step problems: n ≥ 150
4-step problems: n ≥ 100
5+ step problems: n ≥ 50
Total: 450-1,500 problems
```

### Why This Matters

1. **Statistical Power**: Need sufficient samples per difficulty bucket for significance testing
2. **Difficulty Stratification**: Enable analysis of how reasoning complexity affects model performance
3. **Fair Comparisons**: Ensure adequate representation across problem types
4. **Ablation Studies**: Support systematic n-token ablation experiments by difficulty

---

## Approach

### High-Level Strategy

1. **Use Original GSM8K**: Test original problems directly (not clean/corrupted pairs)
   - Simpler: No pair generation needed
   - Faster: No GPT-4 API calls
   - Cheaper: $0 cost
   - Cleaner: Use GSM8K's existing answer format

2. **Test Large Sample**: Test 7,500 problems to ensure sufficient CoT-needed problems
   - GSM8K has 8,792 total problems (1,319 test + 7,473 train)
   - Excluding 532 already-tested = 8,260 available
   - Testing 7,500 provides buffer for low CoT rates

3. **Preserve Existing**: Keep and mark existing 132 problems
   - Mark with `is_existing=True`
   - Prioritize in stratification sampling
   - Maintain continuity with previous experiments

4. **Stratify and Sample**: Filter to target distribution
   - Group by difficulty (2-step, 3-step, 4-step, 5+)
   - Sample to meet targets
   - Randomly select from excess problems

### Technical Pipeline

**End-to-End Script**: `expand_gsm8k_cot_dataset.py`

Orchestrates 5 steps automatically:

1. **Load GSM8K Candidates** (~2 min)
   - Load test set (1,319 problems)
   - Load train set (7,500 sampled)
   - Exclude 532 already-tested
   - Extract answers from `#### N` format

2. **Test CoT Necessity** (~90 min)
   - For each problem:
     - Baseline: `patcher.run_without_patch()` (with 6 CoT tokens)
     - Ablated: All 6 tokens replaced with zeros
     - Mark as needs_cot if baseline_correct AND ablated_wrong
   - Checkpoint every 100 problems
   - Resumable if interrupted

3. **Calculate Difficulty** (~1 min)
   - Parse GSM8K solutions
   - Count `<<calculation>>` blocks
   - Classify: 2-step, 3-step, 4-step, 5+step

4. **Load Existing Problems** (~1 min)
   - Load 132 from `llama_cot_all.json`
   - Filter to clean (original) variants
   - Add difficulty classification
   - Mark as `is_existing=True`

5. **Stratify and Filter** (~1 min)
   - Group by difficulty
   - Keep all existing problems
   - Sample new problems to reach targets
   - Save final stratified dataset

---

## Implementation

### Code Architecture

**Single Pipeline Script**: Reuses existing infrastructure

```python
# Imports existing components
from cache_activations_llama import ActivationCacherLLaMA
from run_ablation_N_tokens_llama import NTokenPatcher, extract_answer_number, answers_match
```

**Key Functions**:
- `load_gsm8k_candidates()`: Load and filter GSM8K
- `test_cot_necessity()`: Run baseline + ablated inference
- `add_difficulty_metrics()`: Parse solutions, count steps
- `load_existing_cot_problems()`: Load existing 132
- `stratify_and_filter()`: Sample to target distribution

**Checkpoint Strategy**:
- Save every 100 problems to `data/gsm8k_expansion_checkpoint.json`
- Resume with `--resume` flag
- Skip testing with `--skip_testing` (use existing checkpoint)

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Full pipeline
python expand_gsm8k_cot_dataset.py --num_samples 7500

# Resume from interruption
python expand_gsm8k_cot_dataset.py --resume

# Skip testing, just stratify (if checkpoint exists)
python expand_gsm8k_cot_dataset.py --skip_testing
```

### Performance Optimization

**Initial Estimate**: 40 GPU-hours (~40 wall-clock hours on single A100)
- Based on conservative 5 inferences/minute
- Assumed slow model loading and processing

**Actual Performance** (10-problem validation):
- Total time: 40 seconds
- Model loading: 30s (one-time)
- Testing 10 problems: 7s (0.7s/problem)
- **Rate: 1.35-1.40 problems/second**

**40× Faster Than Expected!**

**Extrapolated to 7,500 problems**:
- Model loading: 30 seconds
- Testing: 7,500 ÷ 1.35 = 5,556 seconds = **93 minutes**
- Post-processing: ~2 minutes
- **Total: ~1.5 hours** (vs 40 hours estimated)

**Why So Fast?**
1. **Efficient caching**: Model stays in GPU memory
2. **Optimized patching**: Zero activations are fast to create
3. **A100 throughput**: 80GB model handles 1B param model easily
4. **No I/O bottleneck**: Checkpoints only every 100 problems

---

## Validation Testing

### 10-Problem Test

**Purpose**: Validate pipeline and measure actual performance

**Command**:
```bash
python expand_gsm8k_cot_dataset.py --num_samples 10 \
  --output data/test_expansion_10.json \
  --checkpoint_file data/test_checkpoint_10.json
```

**Results**:
- ✅ Pipeline completed successfully
- ✅ Time: 40 seconds (39s actual + 1s overhead)
- ✅ Problems tested: 10
- ✅ Baseline correct: 5/10 (50%)
- ✅ Needs CoT: 2/10 (20%)

**Performance Breakdown**:
```
Model loading:     30s  (75% of total)
Testing 10 probs:   7s  (18% of total)
Difficulty calc:    2s  (5% of total)
Stratification:     1s  (2% of total)
```

**CoT Rate**: 20% (lower than expected 24.8% from pairs)
- May indicate different difficulty distribution in test vs train
- Validates decision to use 7,500 samples (provides buffer)

## Current Run

### Configuration

**Started**: 2025-10-23 18:46 UTC
**PID**: 17145
**Command**: `python expand_gsm8k_cot_dataset.py --num_samples 7500`

**Parameters**:
- Model: `/home/paperspace/codi_ckpt/llama_gsm8k`
- Input: GSM8K test + train sets
- Exclude: 532 already-tested problems
- Output: `data/llama_cot_original_stratified_final.json`
- Checkpoint: `data/gsm8k_expansion_checkpoint.json`
- Checkpoint frequency: Every 100 problems

### Progress Monitoring

**Current Status** (as of 18:48 UTC):
- Problems tested: 114/7,500 (1.5%)
- Rate: 1.33 it/s
- ETA: ~93 minutes total (~91 min remaining)
- Memory usage: 5.7GB RAM

**Monitor command**:
```bash
tail -f expansion_full.log
```

**Check progress**:
```bash
jq '.problems_tested, .needs_cot_count' data/gsm8k_expansion_checkpoint.json
```

## Expected Results

### Projections

Based on 20% CoT rate observed in validation:

**New Problems**:
- Tested: 7,500
- CoT-needed (20%): ~1,500 problems

**Combined with Existing**:
- Existing: 132 problems
- New: ~1,500 problems
- **Total: ~1,632 problems**

**Final Stratified Dataset**:
- Size: 450-1,500 problems (depending on difficulty distribution)
- Targets: 2-step (≥150), 3-step (≥150), 4-step (≥100), 5+ (≥50)

### Risk: Insufficient 5+ Step Problems

**Concern**: Only 11.2% of existing problems are 5+ steps (21/132)

If this rate holds: 1,500 × 0.112 = **168 5+ step problems** ✅ (meets target of 50)

**Mitigation**: Testing 7,500 provides buffer. If insufficient, can:
1. Test more train set problems
2. Lower 5+ step target
3. Accept what's available and document limitation

## Methodology Details

### CoT Necessity Testing

**Baseline Inference** (with CoT):
```python
baseline_output = patcher.run_without_patch(question, max_new_tokens=200)
baseline_pred = extract_answer_number(baseline_output)
baseline_correct = answers_match(baseline_pred, expected)
```

**Ablated Inference** (without CoT):
```python
# Create zero activations for all 6 tokens
sample_act = patcher.cache_N_token_activations(question, 'middle')[0]
zero_activations = [torch.zeros_like(sample_act) for _ in range(6)]

# Run with zeros
ablated_output = patcher.run_with_N_tokens_patched(
    problem_text=question,
    patch_activations=zero_activations,
    layer_name='middle',
    max_new_tokens=200
)

ablated_pred = extract_answer_number(ablated_output)
ablated_correct = answers_match(ablated_pred, expected)
```

**CoT Necessity Criterion**:
```python
needs_cot = baseline_correct and not ablated_correct
```

**Interpretation**: Model **needs CoT** if:
- ✅ Solves correctly WITH continuous thought tokens (baseline)
- ❌ Fails WITHOUT continuous thought tokens (ablated)

### Difficulty Calculation

**Parsing GSM8K Solutions**:

GSM8K solutions use `<<calculation>>` blocks:
```
John has 5 apples. <<5>>
He buys 3 more. <<5+3=8>>
He eats 2. <<8-2=6>>
#### 6
```

**Counting Steps**:
```python
calc_blocks = re.findall(r'<<[^>]+>>', solution_text)
reasoning_steps = len(calc_blocks)
```

**Classification**:
- 1-2 steps → 2-step (easy)
- 3 steps → 3-step (medium)
- 4 steps → 4-step (hard)
- 5+ steps → 5+step (very hard)

---

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Performance Estimation

**Initial Estimate**: 40 hours (40× too high!)

**Lesson**: Conservative estimates based on worst-case inference times don't account for:
- Efficient GPU utilization
- Optimized batching and caching
- Fast zero-activation creation
- Modern hardware throughput

**Takeaway**: Always validate with small-scale test before committing to large runs.

### 2. CoT Rate Variability

**Expected**: 24.8% (based on pair testing)
**Observed**: 20% (on test set sampling)

**Possible Reasons**:
- Different difficulty distribution in test vs train
- Pair generation may have selected harder problems
- Random sampling variability

**Takeaway**: Build in buffer when projecting dataset sizes (used 7,500 vs 5,000).

### 3. Infrastructure Reuse

**Key Success**: Reusing existing `ActivationCacherLLaMA` and `NTokenPatcher` saved enormous development time.

**Lesson**: Investing in clean, reusable infrastructure pays dividends.
