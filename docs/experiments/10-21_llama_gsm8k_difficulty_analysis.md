# LLaMA CoT Difficulty Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-21
**Objective**: Understand what makes problems "easy enough" for LLaMA to solve without Chain-of-Thought reasoning
**Dataset**: 96 matched pairs (after deduplication) where both LLaMA and GPT-2 solve clean and corrupted versions correctly

---

## Executive Summary

### Key Finding: Difficulty Threshold for Direct Computation

**LLaMA-3.2-1B demonstrates a clear capability threshold for bypassing latent CoT:**
- **Easy problems (≤2 steps)**: Only 32% need CoT → **68% use direct computation**
- **Medium problems (3 steps)**: 55% need CoT → 45% use direct computation
- **Hard problems (≥4 steps)**: **100% need CoT** → 0% use direct computation

This suggests LLaMA has developed **specialized circuits for simple arithmetic** that bypass latent reasoning entirely, while GPT-2 (117M) requires CoT for all problems regardless of difficulty.

## Operation Type Analysis

### CoT-Needed Problems (41 problems)
- **Addition**: 1.71 avg, used in 58.5% of problems
- **Subtraction**: 1.05 avg, used in 48.8% of problems
- **Multiplication**: 1.90 avg, used in 63.4% of problems
- **Division**: 1.34 avg, used in 51.2% of problems

### CoT-Skipped Problems (55 problems)
- **Addition**: 1.27 avg, used in 49.1% of problems
- **Subtraction**: 0.60 avg, used in 32.7% of problems
- **Multiplication**: 2.22 avg, used in **83.6%** of problems
- **Division**: 0.55 avg, used in 27.3% of problems

### Key Observation
**CoT-skipped problems have more multiplication** (83.6% vs 63.4%) but **less division** (27.3% vs 51.2%). This suggests:
- LLaMA may have stronger direct computation for multiplication
- Division operations increase CoT necessity

## Difficulty Stratification

| Difficulty | Total | Needs CoT | Skips CoT | CoT Rate |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Easy (≤2 steps)** | 60 | 19 | 41 | **31.7%** |
| **Medium (3 steps)** | 31 | 17 | 14 | **54.8%** |
| **Hard (≥4 steps)** | 5 | 5 | 0 | **100.0%** |

### Critical Insight: Phase Transition at 2-3 Steps

There's a clear **threshold effect**:
- Below 2 steps: LLaMA uses direct computation 68% of the time
- At 3 steps: CoT necessity jumps to 55%
- Above 4 steps: CoT becomes mandatory (100%)

This mirrors the **N-token ablation results** where LLaMA showed a non-linear jump from 30% → 70% recovery when increasing from 2 to 4 tokens, suggesting a **"critical mass" threshold** for latent reasoning.

## Hypotheses Generated

### H1: Direct Computation Threshold
**Hypothesis**: LLaMA can solve problems with ≤2 reasoning steps via direct computation without latent CoT

**Evidence**: Mean steps for skipped-CoT problems = 2.24 (median = 2.0), p=0.0078

**Proposed Test**: Test on additional problems stratified by step count; measure accuracy with/without CoT tokens ablated

---

### H2: Difficulty-Based Computational Pathway Selection
**Hypothesis**: Problem difficulty threshold exists around 2-3 reasoning steps, below which LLaMA uses direct computation 68% of the time

**Evidence**: Easy problems (≤2 steps): 31.7% need CoT; Medium+ problems (≥3 steps): higher CoT dependency

**Proposed Test**: Analyze CoT token activations for easy vs hard problems to confirm different computational pathways; use causal interventions to trace when direct vs latent pathways are selected

---

### H3: Specialized Arithmetic Circuits
**Hypothesis**: LLaMA's latent reasoning capacity is more efficiently utilized for complex multi-step problems than simple arithmetic

**Evidence**: Larger models may have developed specialized circuits for basic arithmetic that bypass latent reasoning

**Proposed Test**: Compare activation patterns in early layers for easy vs hard problems; use probing classifiers to detect arithmetic circuits; test if fine-tuning erases this capability

---

### H4: Model Size Enables Direct Computation
**Hypothesis**: Model size correlates with ability to perform direct computation, explaining the 100% vs 44% CoT dependency gap between GPT-2 and LLaMA

**Evidence**: GPT-2 (117M) needs CoT 100% of the time; LLaMA (1B) only 43% of the time on same problems

**Proposed Test**: Test intermediate model sizes (350M, 700M) to find where direct computation capability emerges; analyze if capability scales linearly or has discrete jumps

---

### H5: Qualitative Reasoning Differences
**Hypothesis**: For problems where LLaMA needs CoT, the latent reasoning is qualitatively different (more abstract/complex) than problems where it skips CoT

**Evidence**: Clear separation in problem complexity metrics (Cohen's d = 0.57 for steps, 0.67 for operations)

**Proposed Test**: Analyze attention patterns and hidden state representations for CoT-needed vs CoT-skipped problems; use dimensionality reduction to visualize reasoning spaces; train probes to predict CoT necessity from intermediate activations

## Implications for CoT Research

### 1. Fair Model Comparison Requires CoT Necessity Testing
- Simply matching problems (both models correct) is insufficient
- Must verify both models actually **use** latent reasoning, not direct computation
- This analysis validates the CoT necessity filtering approach used in previous experiments

### 2. Larger Models Have Multiple Computational Pathways
- LLaMA (1B) can route easy problems through **direct circuits**
- GPT-2 (117M) must use **latent reasoning** for all problems
- Suggests model scaling provides architectural flexibility beyond just capacity

### 3. Latent CoT Token Requirements Scale with Problem Difficulty
- Easy problems that need CoT: may only need 1-2 tokens
- Hard problems: likely need all 6 tokens
- Future work could **dynamically allocate** token budgets based on difficulty

### 4. Training Efficiency Implications
- If easy problems don't use latent tokens, should we train on them?
- May be better to curate training sets focused on problems that benefit from latent reasoning
- Could lead to more efficient CODI training protocols

---

## Limitations

1. **Small hard problem sample**: Only 5 hard problems (≥4 steps), limiting statistical power
2. **Single model architecture**: Only tested LLaMA-3.2-1B; results may not generalize
3. **GSM8K-specific**: Analysis limited to math word problems; other domains may differ
4. **No causal validation**: Haven't directly tested if ablating direct computation circuits increases CoT usage
5. **Correlation not causation**: Difficulty metrics correlate with CoT necessity but don't prove causal relationship

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. **Expand hard problem set**: Find/generate more ≥4 step problems to validate 100% CoT necessity
2. **Activation pattern analysis**: Compare hidden states for CoT-needed vs CoT-skipped problems
3. **Test H2 directly**: Ablate early-layer activations to see if we can force CoT usage on easy problems

### Medium Term
1. **Test intermediate model sizes** (350M, 700M) to find when direct computation emerges
2. **Replicate on other datasets** (MATH, StrategyQA) to test generalization
3. **Dynamic token allocation**: Build adaptive system that uses fewer tokens for easy problems

### Long Term
1. **Mechanistic interpretability**: Identify exact circuits for direct vs latent computation
2. **Training curriculum**: Design CODI training that focuses on CoT-beneficial problems
3. **Multi-modal extension**: Test if similar thresholds exist for code, logic, or vision tasks

## Conclusion

This analysis reveals that **LLaMA-3.2-1B has developed the capability to solve simple math problems (≤2 reasoning steps) via direct computation 68% of the time**, while GPT-2 requires latent CoT reasoning for 100% of the same problems. This represents a fundamental difference in model architectures and suggests that:

1. **Model size enables computational pathway specialization**
2. **Fair cross-model comparisons must filter to CoT-dependent problems**
3. **Latent reasoning research should focus on problems that actually require it**
4. **Future CODI variants could benefit from dynamic token allocation**

The clear **phase transition around 2-3 reasoning steps** provides a concrete threshold for designing future experiments and training protocols, ensuring we study latent reasoning where it matters most.
