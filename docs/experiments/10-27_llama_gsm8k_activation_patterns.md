# LLaMA SAE Feature Activation Patterns & Specialization Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Model**: LLaMA-3.2-1B
**Dataset**: 1,495 validation samples (GSM8K)
**Experiment**: Search for specialized features across activation frequency spectrum

---

## Objective

Find specialized SAE features suitable for causal validation experiments by analyzing:
1. **Operation-specific features**: Activate on specific operations (e.g., multiplication only)
2. **Value-specific features**: Activate on specific numbers (e.g., problems with "12")

Previous taxonomy (Story 1) showed that top-20 features are all highly general. This experiment searches mid and low-frequency features for specialization.

---

## Methodology

### Search Strategy
Analyzed 3 activation frequency ranges:
1. **Mid-frequency** (rank 50-200): 20-57% activation
2. **Early layer** (Layer 3, rank 20-100): 42-96% activation
3. **Low-frequency** (rank 400-512): 0.1-2.8% activation

### Specialization Criteria
**Operation-specialized**:
- One operation >70%, all others <30%
- Example: 85% multiplication, 10% addition, 5% subtraction

**Value-specialized**:
- One number appears in >50% samples, others <20%
- Example: 60% contain "12", 10% contain "20"

**Highly-specialized**:
- Both operation AND value specialized

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Specialization is Inversely Correlated with Activation Frequency

**Observation**:
- Top 200 features (>20% activation): 99.3% general, 0.7% specialized
- Bottom 112 features (<3% activation): 95.4% general, 4.6% specialized

**Interpretation**:
- **Common features are general**: High-frequency features serve as "core computation" features
- **Rare features are specialized**: Low-frequency features capture specific patterns
- This is consistent with sparse coding theory: frequent = general, rare = specific

### Finding 2: Specialized Features Are Too Rare for Reliable Swap Experiments

**Problem**:
- Most specialized features activate on <0.3% of samples (1-5 out of 1,495)
- Example: Feature 194 (subtraction) activates on only 2 samples

**Impact on Causal Validation**:
- **Challenge**: Can't run meaningful swap experiments with so few active samples
- **Minimum needed**: ~20-50 samples per feature for statistical significance
- **Current**: Only 1-5 samples per specialized feature

**Root Cause**:
- Optimal SAE config (K=100, d=512) creates 512 features
- Only 100 active per sample → 412 features rarely used
- Rare features become "corner case detectors" rather than systematic pattern encoders

### Finding 3: No Pure Value-Specific Features Found

**Observation**: Did not find features that activate on specific numbers (12, 50) independent of operation.

**Hypothesis**: Value information may be encoded:
1. **Distributed**: Across multiple features rather than single dedicated feature
2. **Combined**: With operations (e.g., "addition + 100") rather than standalone
3. **In different layers**: Value features may exist in other layers/positions not analyzed

## Implications for Causal Validation (Stories 4-5)

### Challenge: Insufficient Data for Clean Swap Experiments

**Original Plan**:
- Swap "12 feature" with "50 feature"
- Test on 20+ problems containing these numbers
- Measure if answers change predictably

**Reality**:
- Specialized features too rare (<5 activations each)
- Can't reliably test swap hypothesis with so few samples

### Alternative Approaches

**Option 1: Ablation Instead of Swap**
- **Method**: Ablate (zero out) general features and measure impact
- **Example**: Ablate Feature 449 (99.87% activation, all operations)
- **Prediction**: Should hurt overall performance significantly
- **Feasibility**: High - feature activates on 1,493/1,495 samples

**Option 2: Amplification of Rare Features**
- **Method**: Artificially amplify rare specialized features (×2, ×5, ×10)
- **Example**: Amplify Feature 332 (addition specialist)
- **Prediction**: Should bias model toward addition operations
- **Feasibility**: Medium - only 5 active samples to test on

**Option 3: Different SAE Configuration**
- **Method**: Train SAE with larger K (e.g., K=200) to reduce feature death
- **Rationale**: More active features → less rare specialization
- **Feasibility**: Low - requires retraining (not in scope)

## Candidate Feature Pairs for Experiments

### Pair 1: Operation Swap
- **Feature A**: 332 (addition specialist, 0.3% activation)
- **Feature B**: 194 (subtraction specialist, 0.1% activation)
- **Experiment**: Swap addition ↔ subtraction features
- **Prediction**: Should affect operation type in computation
- **Limitation**: Only 5 addition samples + 2 subtraction samples = 7 total tests

**Verdict**: ⚠️ **Feasible but statistically weak** (n=7 too small)

### Pair 2: Value Swap (Highly-Specialized)
- **Feature A**: 392 (addition + 100, 0.1% activation)
- **Feature B**: 350 (addition + 50, 0.1% activation)
- **Experiment**: Swap "100" ↔ "50" features
- **Prediction**: Answers involving 100 should change to 50
- **Limitation**: Only 2 samples with 100 + 1 sample with 50 = 3 total tests

**Verdict**: ❌ **Not feasible** (n=3 too small for meaningful conclusions)

## Recommendations

### For Story 4 (Ground Truth Validation)

**Revised Approach**: Focus on **ablation experiments** instead of swap experiments
1. Select top general features (rank 1-20, >87% activation)
2. Ablate each feature individually
3. Measure impact on accuracy across full test set (1,495 samples)
4. Validate that important features have large impact

**Expected Results**:
- Ablating general features → significant accuracy drop (10-30%)
- Ablating rare specialized features → minimal impact (<1%)
- This validates feature importance ranking

### For Story 5 (Higher-Level Feature Discovery)

**Revised Approach**: Focus on **operation-level analysis** via ablation
1. Identify the 1 multiplication-specialized feature (Feature 156, rank 138)
2. Ablate it and measure impact specifically on multiplication problems
3. Compare impact on multiplication vs other operations
4. Validate operation-level encoding

**Expected Results**:
- Ablating multiplication feature → hurts multiplication problems more than others
- Demonstrates operation-level feature exists (even if rare)
