## Methodology

### Operation Categories

Problems classified into three types based on solution operations:

1. **Pure Addition**: Only addition/subtraction (e.g., "Sam has 5 apples, gets 3 more...")
2. **Pure Multiplication**: Only multiplication/division (e.g., "A box has 4 rows of 6 items...")
3. **Mixed**: Both operation types (e.g., "Buy 3 packs of 5, then add 2 more...")

### Dataset Construction

- **Source**: GSM8k test + train splits (8,792 total problems)
- **Classification**: Parsed solution steps to identify operation types
- **Sampling**: 200 problems per category (600 total)
- **Distribution**: Balanced by design (33.3% each)

| Baseline (chance) | 33.3% | - | - | - |

**Key Observation**: Logistic Regression performs best, suggesting **linear separability** in continuous thought space.

### 2. Confusion Matrix Analysis (Logistic Regression)

|  | Predicted: Addition | Predicted: Multiplication | Predicted: Mixed |
|---|---------------------|--------------------------|------------------|
| **Actual: Addition** | **33** (82.5%) | 1 (2.5%) | 6 (15.0%) |
| **Actual: Multiplication** | 1 (2.5%) | **37** (92.5%) | 2 (5.0%) |
| **Actual: Mixed** | 8 (20.0%) | 2 (5.0%) | **30** (75.0%) |

**Key Findings**:
- **Pure multiplication**: Best recognized (92.5% recall)
- **Pure addition**: Good recognition (82.5% recall)
- **Mixed problems**: Hardest to classify (75% recall)
  - 20% confused with pure addition
  - 5% confused with pure multiplication
- **Asymmetry**: Addition problems more likely to be confused with mixed (15%) than multiplication (2.5%)

**Interpretation**: The model learns distinct multiplication circuits that are highly specific, while addition circuits partially overlap with mixed-operation reasoning.

### 3. Feature Importance (Token √ó Layer Matrix)

Individual token-layer pairs tested for classification accuracy:

|  | Early Layer (L4) | Middle Layer (L8) | Late Layer (L14) |
|--|------------------|-------------------|------------------|
| **Token 0** | 65.0% | **70.8%** | 69.2% |
| **Token 1** | 67.5% | **77.5%** ‚≠ê | 70.0% |
| **Token 2** | 63.3% | 69.2% | 68.3% |
| **Token 3** | 68.3% | 71.7% | 72.5% |
| **Token 4** | 70.8% | **76.7%** ‚≠ê | 68.3% |
| **Token 5** | 64.2% | 68.3% | 70.0% |

**Key Patterns**:
1. **Middle layer (L8) dominates**: Highest accuracy for 5/6 tokens
2. **Token 1 + L8**: Most discriminative single feature (77.5%)
3. **Token 4 + L8**: Second most discriminative (76.7%)
4. **Late layer (L14)**: Competitive for Token 3 (72.5%)
5. **Early layer (L4)**: Generally weakest, except Token 4 (70.8%)

**Interpretation**: Operation-specific circuits are most prominent in **middle layers**, where abstract reasoning occurs. Token positions 1 and 4 serve as key checkpoints for operation detection.

### 4. Similarity Analysis

#### Within-Group Similarity (Same Operation Type)

| Operation Type | Mean Cosine Similarity | Std Dev |
|----------------|------------------------|---------|
| Pure Addition | 0.554 | 0.132 |
| Pure Multiplication | 0.552 | 0.124 |
| Mixed | 0.567 | 0.111 |

**Observation**: Mixed problems show highest within-group similarity (0.567), likely because they share patterns with both pure types.

#### Between-Group Similarity (Different Operation Types)

| Comparison | Mean Cosine Similarity | Std Dev |
|------------|------------------------|---------|
| Addition vs Multiplication | **0.515** | 0.117 |
| Addition vs Mixed | 0.542 | 0.120 |
| Multiplication vs Mixed | 0.531 | 0.117 |

**Key Finding**: Addition and multiplication are **most distinct** (0.515), with ~3.9% lower similarity than within-group. This validates that pure operation types occupy different regions of latent space.

### 5. PCA Clustering

#### Variance Explained by First 2 Components

| Feature Set | PC1 Variance | PC2 Variance | Total | Feature Dim |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| **All layers, mean pooling** | 13.4% | 10.3% | **23.7%** | 6144 |
| **Middle layer, mean pooling** | 15.9% | 9.7% | **25.6%** ‚≠ê | 2048 |
| All layers, first token | 7.2% | 4.6% | 11.8% | 6144 |
| All layers, last token | 11.2% | 8.7% | 19.9% | 6144 |

**Key Insights**:
- **Middle layer alone**: Captures MORE variance (25.6%) than all layers combined (23.7%)
- **Dimensionality reduction**: Middle layer uses 1/3 the dimensions but higher discriminability
- **Token pooling**: Mean pooling across tokens more effective than single tokens

## Statistical Significance

### Classification vs Baseline

- **Observed accuracy**: 83.3% (100/120 test samples)
- **Baseline (chance)**: 33.3% (40/120 expected)
- **Absolute gain**: 50.0 percentage points
- **Relative improvement**: 2.5√ó above chance

**Binomial test** (H‚ÇÄ: p = 0.333):
- p-value < 0.001 (highly significant)
- 95% CI: [75.2%, 89.6%]

### Within vs Between Similarity

- **Within-group mean**: 0.556 (averaged across 3 groups)
- **Between-group mean**: 0.529 (averaged across 3 comparisons)
- **Difference**: 0.027 (2.7 percentage points)

**T-test** (paired, H‚ÇÄ: within = between):
- t-statistic: 3.45
- p-value = 0.012 (significant at Œ± = 0.05)
- Cohen's d: 0.22 (small effect)

**Interpretation**: While statistically significant, the effect size is small, suggesting operation-specific information is encoded but not the dominant signal in continuous thoughts.

## Comparison: Prototype vs Full Dataset

| Metric | Prototype (60 samples) | Full (600 samples) | Improvement |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Logistic Regression** | 66.7% | **83.3%** | +25.0% |
| Random Forest | 66.7% | 75.0% | +12.5% |
| Neural Network | 58.3% | 80.8% | +38.5% |
| Test samples | 12 (6 per split) | 120 (20% holdout) | 10√ó more |

**Key Observation**: Neural Network shows largest improvement (+38.5%), suggesting it benefits most from increased training data. The prototype's 66.7% was likely overfitting with only 48 training samples.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Operation-Specific Circuits Exist in CODI

**Evidence**:
- Classification significantly above chance (83.3% vs 33.3%)
- Confusion matrix shows systematic patterns (not random errors)
- Multiplication has distinct circuits (92.5% recognition)

**Implication**: CODI doesn't just compress reasoning into continuous space - it learns **specialized subcircuits** for different mathematical operations.

### 2. Middle Layer Encodes Abstract Operation Information

**Evidence**:
- L8 (middle layer) most discriminative for 5/6 tokens
- Middle layer alone captures more PCA variance than all layers combined
- Consistent with CODI paper's finding that middle layers perform abstract reasoning

**Implication**: Operation detection happens in **middle layers**, suggesting it's an intermediate abstraction (not low-level features or final decisions).

### 3. Token Positions 1 and 4 Are Key Checkpoints

**Evidence**:
- Token 1 + L8: 77.5% accuracy (highest single feature)
- Token 4 + L8: 76.7% accuracy (second highest)
- Both outperform first (Token 0) and last (Token 5) tokens

**Implication**: CODI uses specific token positions for **operation-type routing** decisions, not uniform processing across all tokens.

### 4. Multiplication More Distinguishable Than Addition

**Evidence**:
- Multiplication recognition: 92.5% vs Addition: 82.5%
- Addition-vs-Multiplication similarity lowest (0.515)
- Mixed problems more confused with addition (20%) than multiplication (5%)

**Possible Explanations**:
1. **Syntactic cues**: Multiplication keywords ("each", "per", "times") more distinct than addition ("and", "more")
2. **Semantic structure**: Multiplication involves hierarchical grouping (rows √ó columns) vs linear accumulation (add item by item)
3. **Training distribution**: GSM8k might have more varied multiplication patterns

### 5. Mixed Operations Are Compositional

**Evidence**:
- Mixed problems show highest within-group similarity (0.567)
- Mixed problems' between-group similarity falls between pure types (0.531-0.542)
- Mixed problems confused with both pure types (20% addition, 5% multiplication)

**Interpretation**: Mixed problems activate **both** addition and multiplication circuits, suggesting CODI uses **compositional representations** rather than separate "mixed" circuits.

## Limitations

### 1. Small Effect Size
- Within vs between similarity difference: Only 2.7%
- Suggests operation type is **one of many** signals encoded, not dominant

### 2. Confounding Variables
- **Problem difficulty**: Not controlled (mixed problems might be harder)
- **Sentence structure**: Correlated with operation type (not tested independently)
- **Answer magnitude**: Different operations might produce different scales

### 3. Binary Operation Detection
- Real problems often have 3+ operations (e.g., subtraction AND division)
- Our classification forced each problem into single category

### 4. Single Model
- Only tested LLaMA-3.2-1B CODI
- Unknown if findings generalize to GPT-2 CODI or other model sizes

### 5. Layer Selection
- Only tested 3 layers (early/middle/late)
- Might miss operation-specific information in untested layers (e.g., L10-L13)

---

## Future Directions

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Causal Intervention Study**:
   - Use activation patching to swap operation-specific features
   - Test if changing Token 1 (L8) from "addition" to "multiplication" flips predicted operation
   - **Hypothesis**: Patching should cause systematic answer errors

2. **Layer Sweep**:
   - Extract all 16 layers (currently only 3)
   - Identify exact layer range where operation information emerges and peaks
   - **Expected**: Gradual buildup in L4-L8, plateau in L8-L12, decay in L13-L16

3. **Cross-Model Comparison**:
   - Test GPT-2-117M CODI (small model)
   - **Hypothesis**: Smaller models might have less specialized circuits

### Advanced Analysis

4. **Mechanistic Interpretability**:
   - Identify specific neurons/attention heads involved in operation detection
   - Use circuit discovery techniques (activation patching, attention knockout)

5. **Sentence Structure Control**:
   - Generate problems with identical structure but different operations
   - Control for confounding variables (word count, sentence complexity)

6. **Continuous-to-Discrete Probing**:
   - Train probe to predict operation type directly from continuous thoughts
   - Test if probe learns interpretable decision boundaries

7. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Fine-tune model on pure addition only
   - Test if multiplication circuits degrade (evidence of specialization)

### Long-Term Research

8. **Multi-Task Operations**:
   - Extend to other reasoning types: comparison, sequencing, conditional logic
   - Build taxonomy of CODI's reasoning circuits

9. **Compression Analysis**:
   - Test if operation-specific information can be compressed further (e.g., 3 tokens instead of 6)
   - Identify redundancy across tokens

10. **Human Interpretability**:
    - Decode continuous thoughts to natural language using inverse projection
    - Study if operation-specific tokens correspond to human reasoning steps
