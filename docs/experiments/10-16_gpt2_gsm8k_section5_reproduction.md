## Results

### Overall Accuracy

| Metric | Result | Paper (Table 1) | Match % |
|--------|--------|-----------------|---------|
| **GSM8K Test Accuracy** | **43.21%** | 43.7% | **98.9%** |
| Correct Predictions | 570/1,319 | ~577/1,319 | 98.8% |
| Incorrect Predictions | 749/1,319 | ~742/1,319 | - |

‚úÖ **Validation**: Successfully reproduced the paper's core result with <1% variance.

### Continuous Thought Interpretability

Each of the 1,319 examples was analyzed with:
- **7 continuous thought tokens** decoded to vocabulary space (initial + 6 iterations)
- **Top-10 tokens** per thought (vs. paper's top-5)
- **Probability scores** for each decoded token
- **Step-by-step comparison** with reference CoT

### Step Correctness Analysis

**Observation**: The decoded continuous thoughts show consistent patterns but lower numerical matching than reported in paper Table 3:

| Problem Complexity | Our Result | Paper (Table 3) | Discrepancy |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1-step problems | 6.7% (n=30) | 97.1% | -90.4pp |
| 2-step problems | 2.8% (n=236) | 83.9% | -81.1pp |
| 3-step problems | 2.8% (n=180) | 75.0% | -72.2pp |
| 4-step problems | 3.3% (n=91) | - | - |
| 5-step problems | 2.1% (n=24) | - | - |

**Analysis of Discrepancy**:

The large gap suggests our interpretation validation algorithm may be measuring something different than the paper's methodology. Specifically:

1. **Decoding Pattern**: All examples show similar decoded tokens (`' 13'`, `'-'`, `' 9'`, etc.) suggesting these tokens may represent:
   - Semantic markers rather than literal intermediate results
   - Compressed reasoning representations
   - Position-dependent thought patterns

2. **Validation Approach**: Our validator compares decoded tokens directly to reference CoT numerical results, but the paper may have used:
   - A different decoding strategy (e.g., beam search, aggregating multiple tokens)
   - Semantic similarity metrics
   - Manual annotation of intermediate results
   - Different continuous thought extraction method

3. **Correct Final Answers**: Despite low step-level matching, the model achieves **43.21% final answer accuracy**, confirming effective reasoning occurs in continuous space.

## Continuous Thought Patterns

### Example: Correct Prediction

**Question**: "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?"

**Reference CoT**: `<<16-3-4=9>> <<9*2=18>>`
**Ground Truth**: 18.0
**Predicted**: 18.0 ‚úì

**Decoded Continuous Thoughts** (Top-3):
```
Thought 0 (initial): [' 13', '13', ' 12']
Thought 1: ['-', ' than', ' instead']
Thought 2: [' 9', '9', ' 8']
Thought 3: ['-', ' than', ' (']
Thought 4: ['9', ' 9', ' any']
Thought 5: ['-', ' than', ' instead']
Thought 6: ['9', ' 9', ' 7']
```

**Observations**:
- Thought 2 and 4-6 decode to '9' or ' 9' (first intermediate result in reference CoT is 9)
- Thought 1, 3, 5 decode to operators/connectives (`'-'`, `' than'`)
- Final answer (18) is correct despite non-literal intermediate representations

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Successfully Validated

1. **Overall Accuracy**: 43.21% closely matches paper's 43.7%
2. **Model Functionality**: CODI successfully reasons in continuous latent space
3. **Output Segregation**: Clean separation of correct/incorrect predictions enables targeted analysis
4. **Decoding Capability**: Can project continuous thoughts to vocabulary space
5. **Final Answer Accuracy**: Confirms effective multi-step reasoning

### üîç Requires Further Investigation

1. **Step Correctness Methodology**: Large gap from paper's Table 3 suggests:
   - Need to clarify paper's exact validation approach
   - May require different decoding strategy (beam search, aggregation)
   - Could indicate our validator measures token-level vs. semantic-level matching

2. **Repeated Decoding Patterns**: Same tokens (`' 13'`, `'-'`, `' 9'`) appear across examples:
   - May indicate position-based thought encoding
   - Could represent semantic markers rather than literal values
   - Warrants investigation into continuous thought semantics

3. **Interpretability Semantics**: What do the decoded tokens actually represent?
   - Direct intermediate computation results?
   - Compressed reasoning markers?
   - Position-dependent thought patterns?
   - Abstract semantic representations?

## Technical Implementation Details

### Continuous Thought Decoding Algorithm

```python
# For each continuous thought token
hidden_state = model.codi(inputs_embeds=latent_embd, ...)[-1][:, -1, :]

# Project to vocabulary space
logits = model.codi.lm_head(hidden_state)
probs = softmax(logits, dim=-1)
topk_probs, topk_indices = torch.topk(probs, k=10, dim=-1)

# Decode to tokens
topk_decoded = [tokenizer.decode([idx]) for idx in topk_indices]
```

### Step Validation Algorithm

```python
# Extract reference steps from CoT
reference_steps = extract_intermediate_steps(cot_text)  # e.g., ["10√∑5=2", "2√ó2=4"]

# Extract numerical results
reference_results = [float(step.split('=')[-1]) for step in reference_steps]  # [2.0, 4.0]

# Decode continuous thoughts
decoded_steps = [top1_token for thought in continuous_thoughts]

# Extract numbers from decoded tokens
decoded_results = [extract_numbers(step) for step in decoded_steps]

# Compare with tolerance
correctness = [abs(ref - dec) < 0.01 for ref, dec in zip(reference_results, decoded_results)]
```

**Issue**: This compares token-level numerical extraction, which may not capture semantic reasoning.

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Investigate Decoding Patterns**
   - Analyze why all examples show similar token sequences
   - Check if decoding is happening correctly across different examples
   - Verify continuous thought extraction logic

2. **Clarify Paper Methodology**
   - Review paper's Section 5.1 description more carefully
   - Check if paper uses different decoding strategy
   - Contact authors if methodology remains unclear

3. **Alternative Validation Approaches**
   - Try semantic similarity metrics (embeddings cosine similarity)
   - Aggregate multi-token sequences before comparison
   - Use beam search decoding instead of greedy
   - Manual annotation of sample to establish ground truth

### Future Experiments

1. **OOD Evaluation**: Run Section 5 analysis on SVAMP, GSM-Hard, MultiArith
2. **Ablation Studies**: Vary number of continuous thoughts (3, 6, 9, 12)
3. **Attention Analysis**: Extract and visualize attention patterns
4. **Different Models**: Try CODI-LLaMA (66.5% accuracy expected)
5. **Decoding Strategies**: Compare greedy vs. beam search vs. sampling
