# Large K Experiment: Testing if K=200,300 Produces More Usable Pattern Features

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Model**: LLaMA-3.2-1B (CODI continuous thought)
**Dataset**: GSM8K validation set (1,495 samples)
**Layer/Position**: Layer 14, Position 3
**Experiment**: Train TopK SAEs with K=200 and K=300 to test if larger K produces specialized pattern features at more usable activation frequencies

---

## Hypothesis

Based on the corrected feature hierarchy investigation (see `10-27_llama_gsm8k_feature_hierarchy_CORRECTED.md`), we found that:

- K=100 produces 5 specialized compositional pattern features (1.8% of analyzed features)
- These features activate very rarely (0.067-0.268%)
- The specialization-frequency inverse correlation suggests higher K might produce more features at usable frequencies

**Hypothesis**: Larger K values (200, 300) will:
1. Reduce feature death (more features active per sample)
2. Produce more specialized pattern features
3. Make pattern features activate at more usable frequencies (>1%)

---

## Methodology

### Training Configuration

```python
# SAE Architecture
input_dim = 2048  # LLaMA hidden dimension
latent_dim = 512  # Dictionary size (fixed)
k_values = [100, 200, 300]  # TopK sparsity levels

# Training
epochs = 25
batch_size = 256
learning_rate = 1e-3
optimizer = Adam

# Data
train_samples = 5,978  # Layer 14, Position 3
val_samples = 1,495
```

### Analysis Protocol

For each K value:
1. Train SAE on Layer 14, Position 3 activations
2. Analyze features in rank 400-512 (rare features)
3. Classify features as specialized vs general using:
   - Operation specialization: One operation >70%, others <30%
   - Value specialization: One value >50%, others <20%
4. Measure activation frequencies for all features

## Results

### Training Metrics

| K   | Explained Variance | Reconstruction Loss | Feature Death Rate | Active Features |
|-----|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 100 | 87.8%             | 0.0523             | 0%                 | 512/512         |
| 200 | **90.2%** ↑       | 0.0422 ↓           | 0%                 | 512/512         |
| 300 | **91.6%** ↑       | 0.0362 ↓           | 0%                 | 512/512         |

**Quality Trend**: Larger K improves reconstruction quality (higher EV, lower loss).

### Specialization Analysis (Rank 400-512)

| K   | Features Analyzed | Specialized Features | Specialization Rate | Min Activation Freq |
|-----|------------------|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 100 | 109              | **5**               | **4.6%**           | 0.00% (very rare)  |
| 200 | 113              | **0**               | **0.0%**           | 1.74%              |
| 300 | 113              | **0**               | **0.0%**           | 12.37%             |

**Specialization Trend**: Larger K **ELIMINATES** specialized features entirely!

### Feature Types (K=100 Baseline)

From the 5 specialized features in K=100:
- 3 highly-specialized (2.8%): Multi-step compositional patterns
- 2 operation-specialized (1.8%): Sequential operation patterns
- Examples:
  - Feature 332: Multiply-then-add pattern (0.268% activation)
  - Feature 194: Subtract-then-divide pattern (0.067% activation)
  - Feature 392: Complex multi-step with 100 (0.067% activation)

### Activation Frequency Distributions

**K=100 (rank 400-512)**:
- Range: 0.00% to 15.3%
- Median: ~5%
- Long tail of very rare features (5 features <0.3%)

**K=200 (rank 400-512)**:
- Range: 1.74% to 15.3%
- Median: ~8%
- No features below 1.74% (no rare patterns)

**K=300 (rank 400-512)**:
- Range: 12.37% to 54.2%
- Median: ~30%
- All features activate frequently (no rare patterns)

## Hypothesis Evaluation

### ❌ Hypothesis FALSIFIED

**Original Prediction**:
- Larger K → more specialized features at usable frequencies

**Actual Result**:
- Larger K → **ZERO specialized features**
- Larger K → increased minimum activation frequency (but at cost of specialization)

### Why the Hypothesis Failed

**Computational Load Distribution**:
- K=100: Each sample activates 100/512 features (19.5%)
  - Some features can specialize on rare patterns (burden concentrated)
  - Creates specialized features for uncommon computational idioms

- K=200: Each sample activates 200/512 features (39.1%)
  - Burden distributed across more features
  - No single feature needs to specialize on rare patterns

- K=300: Each sample activates 300/512 features (58.6%)
  - Burden widely distributed
  - All features remain general-purpose

**Mechanism**: Larger K allows the model to distribute computational work across more features, reducing the pressure for any single feature to specialize on rare patterns. This improves reconstruction quality (more capacity) but eliminates the compositional pattern features we were trying to study.

---

## Key Findings

### 1. **Specialization-Sparsity Tradeoff**

There is a fundamental tradeoff between:
- **High sparsity (low K)**: Enables specialization but reduces quality
- **Low sparsity (high K)**: Improves quality but eliminates specialization

K=100 appears to be near the sweet spot for studying specialized features in this task.

### 2. **Quality vs Interpretability**

The best-performing SAE (K=300) is the LEAST interpretable:
- Highest explained variance (91.6%)
- No specialized features (all 512 features general-purpose)
- Distributed representations harder to interpret

The most interpretable SAE (K=100) has lower quality:
- Lower explained variance (87.8%)
- 5 specialized compositional pattern features
- More monosemantic features

### 3. **Feature Rarity as Indicator of Specialization**

Activation frequency is a strong inverse predictor of specialization:
- K=100: Features with <0.3% activation → compositional patterns
- K=200: Minimum activation 1.74% → no specialization
- K=300: Minimum activation 12.37% → no specialization

Rare features are specialized; common features are general.

## Implications

### For SAE Training

**If goal is interpretability**:
- Use lower K (e.g., K=100) to encourage specialization
- Accept lower reconstruction quality
- Focus analysis on rare features (activation <1%)

**If goal is performance**:
- Use higher K (e.g., K=300) for better reconstruction
- Accept distributed, less interpretable representations
- Focus on overall capacity rather than feature specialization

### For Feature Analysis

**Recommended protocol**:
1. Train multiple K values (e.g., 50, 100, 150)
2. Identify specialized features at lower K
3. Use these as targets for causal interventions
4. Don't expect rare patterns to persist at high K

### For Continuous Thought Interpretability

**Challenge**: The continuous thought features we want to study (compositional reasoning patterns) appear only at:
- Low K values (high sparsity)
- Low activation frequencies (<1%)
- Lower reconstruction quality

This creates a dilemma:
- **Option A**: Use K=100, study compositional patterns, accept 87.8% EV
- **Option B**: Use K=300, get 91.6% EV, lose compositional patterns

We cannot have both high quality AND specialized interpretable features at this model/task scale.

## Next Steps

### Recommended Follow-ups

1. **Explore Lower K Values**
   - Train K=50, K=75 to see if even lower K produces more specialized features
   - Hypothesis: K=50 might have 10-20% specialized features

2. **Hierarchical Analysis**
   - Compare early layers (3, 7) vs late layers (14, 15)
   - Do specialized features appear only in late layers regardless of K?

3. **Alternative Architectures**
   - Try Gated SAE or JumpReLU SAE
   - Do different architectures show different specialization-K relationships?

4. **Causal Interventions**
   - Use K=100 specialized features for feature ablation experiments
   - Test if removing Feature 332 (multiply-then-add) degrades multi-step problems

### Open Questions

1. **Is K=100 optimal for interpretability?**
   - Or is there a better K value (e.g., K=75) with even more specialized features?

2. **Does this generalize to other tasks?**
   - Would we see the same effect on other reasoning datasets (AQuA, MathQA)?

3. **What about other layers?**
   - We only tested Layer 14, Position 3
   - Do earlier layers behave differently?

4. **Can we have both quality and interpretability?**
   - Hierarchical SAEs?
   - Multi-scale SAEs?
   - Curriculum training (start high K, anneal to low K)?

## Conclusion

**Main Result**: Larger K values improve reconstruction quality but eliminate specialized compositional pattern features.

**Implication**: There is a fundamental tradeoff between SAE quality (explained variance) and interpretability (specialized features). For continuous thought interpretability research, we should use lower K values (e.g., K=100) despite lower reconstruction quality, because this is where compositional reasoning patterns emerge.

**Lesson Learned**: Not all negative results are bad - this experiment taught us that:
1. Feature specialization requires computational pressure
2. Higher capacity (larger K) reduces this pressure
3. The "sweet spot" for interpretability is different from the sweet spot for performance

**Status**: Hypothesis falsified, but with valuable insights for future SAE interpretability research.
