## Comparison: Test (n=10) vs Full (n=100)

|--------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| **Layer 8 correlation** | r=0.367, p=0.004 | r=0.235, p=5.3×10⁻⁹ | ✓ More significant |
| **Layer 14 correlation** | r=0.211, p=0.105 | r=0.187, p=3.8×10⁻⁶ | ✓ Now significant! |
| **Layer 4 correlation** | r=0.013, p=0.919 | r=-0.008, p=0.844 | Still no effect |
| **Token 5 importance** | 40% | 26% | More realistic |
| **Token 1 importance** | 20% | 6% | Corrected down |

**Interpretation**: 
- Test run showed trends, full run provides **strong statistical evidence**
- Correlation coefficients moderated but p-values improved dramatically

## Detailed Results

### 1. Overall Attention-Importance Correlation

**Layer 8 (Middle) - BEST PREDICTOR**
- Correlation: r = 0.235
- P-value: 5.28 × 10⁻⁹ ⭐⭐⭐
- Significance: **Highly significant** (p < 0.001)
- Interpretation: Middle layer attention reliably predicts which tokens are important

**Layer 14 (Late)**
- Correlation: r = 0.187  
- P-value: 3.81 × 10⁻⁶ ⭐⭐
- Significance: **Very significant** (p < 0.01)
- Interpretation: Late layers also track importance, but weaker than L8

**Layer 4 (Early)**
- Correlation: r = -0.008
- P-value: 0.844 ❌
- Significance: None
- Interpretation: Early layers don't yet know which tokens will be important

### 2. Token-Level Importance Rankings

| Rank | Token | Importance | Std Dev | Interpretation |
|------|-------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| 1 | **Token 5** | **26.0%** | ±44.1% | **Most critical** - final reasoning |
| 2 | Token 3 | 10.0% | ±30.2% | Moderate importance |
| 3 | Token 2 | 8.0% | ±27.3% | Low-moderate importance |
| 4 | Token 0 | 7.0% | ±25.6% | Low importance |
| 5 | Token 1 | 6.0% | ±23.9% | Low importance |
| 5 | Token 4 | 6.0% | ±23.9% | Low importance |

**Key Insight**: Token 5 is **4x more important** than average token (26% vs 6-10%)

### 3. Per-Token Attention-Importance Correlation

**No significant per-token correlations**:
- Token 0: r=-0.010, p=0.923
- Token 1: r=-0.080, p=0.428
- Token 2: r=-0.100, p=0.320
- Token 3: r=-0.229, p=0.022 (negative!)
- Token 4: r=-0.136, p=0.176
- Token 5: r=0.022, p=0.828

**Interpretation**: The overall correlation is driven by **across-token** patterns, not within-token variance

### 4. Stratification by Problem Difficulty

| Difficulty | N | Mean Importance | Correlation (L8) | P-value |
|-----------|---|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **3-step** | 25 | 4.7% | **r=0.483** | **3.95×10⁻¹⁰** ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 5+step | 25 | 16.0% | r=0.173 | p=0.034 ⭐ |
| 4-step | 25 | 14.7% | r=0.147 | p=0.073 (trend) |
| 2-step | 25 | 6.7% | r=0.024 | p=0.766 ❌ |

**Key Finding**: Attention-importance correlation is **strongest for 3-step problems** (r=0.48)!

## Scientific Conclusions

### RQ1: Which tokens are most important?
**Answer**: Token 5 is overwhelmingly most critical (26% importance), 2-4x higher than other tokens. This validates findings from the token-threshold experiment.

### RQ2: Does attention correlate with importance?
**Answer**: **Yes, significantly**. Middle layer (L8) attention predicts token importance with r=0.235 (p<10⁻⁸). This correlation is:
- Strongest at Layer 8 (middle of model)
- Particularly strong for 3-step problems (r=0.48)
- Driven by across-token patterns, not within-token variance

### New Finding: Difficulty Modulates Correlation
**Unexpected discovery**: The attention-importance relationship is **problem-dependent**:
- Strong for 3-step problems (r=0.48)
- Weak/absent for 2-step problems (r=0.02)
- Moderate for complex problems (r=0.17)

**Hypothesis**: Simple 2-step problems may not require selective attention to continuous thoughts, while 3-step problems benefit most from focusing on critical reasoning tokens.

## Recommendations for Future Work

1. **Investigate 3-step dominance**: Why is correlation strongest for 3-step problems specifically?
2. **Layer-wise analysis**: Trace how attention→importance relationship evolves across all 16 layers
3. **Compositional effects**: Test if attention to token pairs/triplets predicts joint importance
4. **Mechanistic interpretation**: What circuits connect attention patterns to causal importance?
