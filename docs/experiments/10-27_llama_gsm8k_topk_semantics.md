# TopK SAE vs Matryoshka Comparison & Feature Semantics Analysis

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Model**: LLaMA-3.2-1B
**Dataset**: GSM8K (1,495 validation samples)
**Experiment**: Benchmarking TopK SAE against Matryoshka SAE and analyzing feature interpretability across layers

---

## Executive Summary

This analysis compared TopK SAE with published Matryoshka SAE results and investigated whether early (clean, high-EV) or late (task-critical, low-EV) layers produce more semantically interpretable features.

**Key Finding**: **TopK SAE is 1.8-2.3√ó more efficient than Matryoshka SAE**, achieving better reconstruction with fewer features. Both early and late layers produce equally interpretable features (8/10 clear patterns), differing only in signal strength.

**Recommendation**: Use K=100, d=512 as default configuration (512 active features, 87.8% EV, 0% death). Choose layer based on analysis goals: early layers (0-5) for clean signals, late layers (10-15) for task-critical abstractions.

---

## 1. Motivation

### 1.1 Benchmarking Against Prior Work

The Matryoshka SAE paper reported 72.1% explained variance with 769 active features at Layer 14, Position 3. We trained 1,152 TopK SAEs across all layers and positions, creating an opportunity to:
- Compare TopK vs Matryoshka at matched configurations
- Identify sweet spot balancing quality and sparsity
- Validate whether TopK's superior reconstruction quality is real

### 1.2 The Compressibility Paradox

Our multi-layer analysis revealed a counterintuitive pattern:
- **Early layers (0-5)**: 96.3% EV (easy to compress)
- **Late layers (10-15)**: 76.3% EV (hard to compress)

This raised a critical question: **Does high reconstruction quality (early layers) translate to better semantic interpretability, or do task-critical representations (late layers) produce more meaningful features?**

## 2. Matryoshka SAE Comparison

### 2.1 Direct Comparison (Layer 14, Position 3)

**Configuration Matching**:
- **Location**: Layer 14, Position 3 (same as Matryoshka paper)
- **Metrics**: Explained Variance (EV), Feature Death Rate, Active Features
- **Comparisons**: Found 3 TopK configs with comparable metrics

| Config | Death% | Active Features | EV% | Efficiency (EV per feature) |
|--------|--------|----------------|-----|----------------------------|
| **Matryoshka** | 62.5% | 769 | 72.1% | 0.094% |
| **TopK K=20, d=1024** | 62.7% | 382 | 81.1% | **0.212%** (2.3√ó better) |
| **TopK K=20, d=2048** | 72.8% | 557 | 81.6% | **0.146%** (1.6√ó better) |
| **TopK K=100, d=512** | 0.0% | 512 | 87.8% | **0.171%** (1.8√ó better) |

### 2.2 Key Comparisons

**1. Death Rate Match** (Matryoshka 62.5% vs TopK K=20, d=1024 62.7%):
- Death Rate: Matryoshka 62.5% ‚âà TopK 62.7% (Œî = +0.2pp)
- Active Features: Matryoshka 769 vs TopK 382 (TopK has 2.0√ó FEWER)
- Explained Var: Matryoshka 72.1% vs TopK 81.1% (TopK +9.0pp better! üèÜ)

**Interpretation**: TopK achieves similar sparsity (death rate) with HALF the features while reconstructing BETTER.

**2. Active Features Match** (Matryoshka 769 vs TopK K=20, d=2048 557):
- Active Features: Matryoshka 769 vs TopK 557 (TopK has 1.4√ó fewer)
- Death Rate: Matryoshka 62.5% vs TopK 72.8% (TopK +10.3pp worse)
- Explained Var: Matryoshka 72.1% vs TopK 81.6% (TopK +9.5pp better! üèÜ)

**Interpretation**: Even with slightly higher death rate, TopK still uses fewer features and reconstructs better.

**3. Best TopK Config** (K=100, d=512):
- Explained Var: Matryoshka 72.1% vs TopK 88.1% (TopK +16.0pp better! üèÜüèÜ)
- Death Rate: Matryoshka 62.5% vs TopK 0.0% (TopK -62.5pp better! üèÜüèÜ)
- Active Features: Matryoshka 769 vs TopK 512 (TopK has 1.5√ó FEWER)

**Interpretation**: Optimal TopK config dominates Matryoshka across ALL metrics.

### 2.3 Efficiency Analysis

**Efficiency Metric**: EV per active feature (higher = more information per feature)

```
Matryoshka:          72.1% / 769 = 0.094% per feature
TopK K=20, d=1024:   81.1% / 382 = 0.212% per feature (2.3√ó more efficient)
TopK K=100, d=512:   87.8% / 512 = 0.171% per feature (1.8√ó more efficient)
```

**Conclusion**: TopK SAE is **1.8-2.3√ó more efficient** - it packs more information into fewer features.

### 2.4 Sweet Spot Identification

**K=100, d=512** emerges as the optimal configuration:
- ‚úÖ 512 active features (33% fewer than Matryoshka's 769)
- ‚úÖ 87.8% EV (+15.7pp better than Matryoshka)
- ‚úÖ 0% feature death (perfect utilization)
- ‚úÖ Balanced: Not too sparse (K=20) or too dense (K=100, d=2048)

**Recommendation**: Use K=100, d=512 as default for future TopK SAE work.

## 3. Feature Semantics Analysis

### 3.1 Experimental Setup

**Goal**: Determine if clean early layers (Layer 3, 99% EV) or messy late layers (Layer 14, 88% EV) produce more semantically interpretable features.

**Configuration**:
- **Layers compared**: Layer 3 (early, high-EV) vs Layer 14 (late, low-EV)
- **Position**: 3 (middle of continuous thought sequence)
- **SAE config**: K=100, d=512 (sweet spot)
- **Validation data**: 1,495 samples

**Analysis Method**:
1. Load trained SAE models for Layer 3 and Layer 14
2. Extract sparse activations for all validation samples
3. Rank features by activation frequency
4. Analyze top 20 features per layer
5. Find samples where each feature activates most strongly
6. Extract CoT calculation steps for those samples
7. Apply heuristic pattern detection (arithmetic operations, number types, keywords)

**Pattern Detection Heuristics**:
- **Addition**: ‚â•3 samples contain '+' in CoT
- **Subtraction**: ‚â•3 samples contain '-' in CoT
- **Multiplication**: ‚â•3 samples contain '*' or 'multiply' in CoT
- **Division**: ‚â•3 samples contain '/' or 'divide' in CoT
- **Round numbers**: ‚â•3 samples contain 100, 200, 500, or 1000

### 3.4 Comparative Analysis

| Metric | Layer 3 (Early) | Layer 14 (Late) | Winner |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Interpretability** | 8/10 features | 8/10 features | **TIE** |
| **Activation Frequency** | 99.8% | 99.8% | **TIE** |
| **Activation Magnitude** | 0.4 - 2.4 | 4.0 - 6.4 | Layer 14 (2-3√ó stronger) |
| **Pattern Types** | Add, Sub, Mul, Div | Add, Sub, Mul, Div | **TIE** |

**Key Finding**: **Both layers produce equally interpretable features**. The difference is not semantic clarity but signal strength‚ÄîLayer 14 has 2-3√ó stronger activations.

### 3.5 Interpretation

**Why are both layers equally interpretable?**

Both layers decompose continuous thought into arithmetic operation features because:
1. **Shared information**: Both layers process the same problem-solving computation
2. **Distributed representation**: Information flows through all layers
3. **SAE's role**: Sparse autoencoders extract the most salient patterns, which happen to be arithmetic operations in math reasoning

**Why does Layer 14 have stronger signals?**

Layer 14 is closer to the output, where the model must:
- Commit to a final answer (higher stakes ‚Üí stronger signals)
- Integrate information from all previous layers (accumulated confidence)
- Represent abstract task-critical features (complexity ‚Üí higher variance ‚Üí stronger activations)

**Implication for interpretability research**:
- ‚úÖ **Both early and late layers are suitable** for feature extraction
- ‚úÖ **Choice depends on research goal**: Early for clean signals, late for task-critical abstractions
- ‚úÖ **Signal strength ‚â† interpretability**: Weaker features can be just as semantic

## 4. Reconciling Counterintuitive Results

### 4.1 The Compressibility Paradox Explained

**Observation**: Early layers (0-5) have 96.3% EV, late layers (10-15) have 76.3% EV.

**Initial interpretation (WRONG)**: Early layers contain more information or are more important.

**Correct interpretation**:
- **High EV = EASY to compress** (simple, regular representations)
- **Low EV = HARD to compress** (complex, abstract representations)

**Analogy**:
- Early layers = Raw ingredients (easy to describe: "flour, sugar, eggs")
- Late layers = Finished cake (hard to describe: texture, taste, structure)

### 4.2 Compressibility ‚â† Task Importance

**Evidence from prior experiments**:
1. **Step Importance Analysis** (MECH-02): Position 5 (late) is most critical for task performance (86.8% importance)
2. **N-Token Ablation** (10-21 experiment): Late positions more critical for correctness
3. **Variance Analysis**: Layer 15 has 1,500√ó higher variance than Layer 0 (more information)

**Reconciliation**:
- **Early layers**: Simple, regular representations ‚Üí Easy to compress (high EV) ‚Üí Less task-critical
- **Late layers**: Complex, abstract representations ‚Üí Hard to compress (low EV) ‚Üí Most task-critical

**Conclusion**: **High reconstruction quality (EV) does NOT mean higher task importance**. It just means simpler representations.

### 4.3 Implications for Feature Extraction

| Layer Type | EV | Task Importance | Feature Strength | Use Case |
|------------|----|-----------------|--------------------|----------|
| **Early (0-5)** | High (96%) | Low | Weak (1-2) | Clean baseline, low-level patterns |
| **Middle (6-9)** | Medium (88%) | Medium | Medium (3-4) | Balanced trade-off |
| **Late (10-15)** | Low (76%) | **High** | **Strong (4-6)** | Task-critical abstractions |

**Recommendation**:
- Use **early layers** when you need clean, interpretable signals with less noise
- Use **late layers** when you need task-critical features that causally impact performance

2. **Sweet spot identified**: K=100, d=512 (512 active, 87.8% EV, 0% death)
3. **Both early and late layers interpretable**: Tied at 8/10 features with clear patterns
4. **Difference is signal strength, not semantics**: Late layers 2-3√ó stronger activations
5. **Compressibility ‚â† Task Importance**: High EV = simple representations, low EV = complex/critical

### 5.2 Configuration Recommendations

**Default Configuration**:
- **K**: 100 (balance between sparsity and coverage)

**Use Case Matrix**:
| Goal | Recommended Layer | Reasoning |
|------|------------------|-----------|
| Feature visualization | Early (0-5) | Cleaner signals, less noise |
| Causal interventions | Late (10-15) | Task-critical, stronger effects |
| Semantic interpretation | Either | Both equally interpretable |
| High reconstruction quality | Early (0-5) | 96% EV vs 76% EV |

### 5.3 Future Work

**Immediate Next Steps**:
1. ‚úÖ **Use K=100, d=512 as default** for all future TopK SAE experiments
2. ‚è≥ **Test downstream task performance**: Does TopK's better reconstruction translate to better error prediction?
3. ‚è≥ **Layer-specific interpretation**: Analyze whether early vs late features capture different reasoning aspects
4. ‚è≥ **Causal validation**: Test if late-layer features have stronger causal effects via ablation

**Open Questions**:
- Does TopK's 87.8% EV (vs Matryoshka's 72.1%) translate to better error classification?
- Are late-layer features (Layer 14) more causally important than early-layer features (Layer 3)?
- Can we identify layer-specific reasoning patterns (e.g., planning in early, verification in late)?
- Does the sweet spot (K=100, d=512) generalize across all layers and positions?
