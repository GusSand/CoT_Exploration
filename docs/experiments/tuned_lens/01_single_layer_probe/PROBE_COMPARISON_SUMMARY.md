## Key Insights

### 1. Trailing Space "Errors" Are Often Near-Misses

Many hard failures are actually very close semantically:

```
Probe: ' 9' (space + 9)   vs   Target: '9' (no space)
Probe: ' 40'              vs   Target: '40'
Probe: '-'                vs   Target: ' -'
```

**Impact:**
- Hard top-1: ✗ Counted as failure
- Top-5 overlap: ✓ Often both variants in top-5
- Probability cosine: 0.7-0.9 (high agreement)
- Semantic match: ✓ Same number/symbol

**Conclusion:** The probe learns the *semantic* pattern but can't always predict context-dependent spacing.

### 2. Top-5 Overlap is More Informative Than Top-1

| Criterion | Balanced | Hybrid | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Top-1 exact match | 30.0% | 32.67% | Probe must predict exact top token |
| Top-5 overlap ≥1 | 79.8% | 85.2% | At least one token in common |
| Top-5 overlap ≥2 | 51.1% | 60.1% | Captures token neighborhood |
| Prob cos sim >0.5 | ~35% | ~45% | Distribution-level similarity |

**Conclusion:** While exact matching is hard (32.67%), the probe demonstrates meaningful learning by placing correct tokens in top-5 (85.2%) and capturing 2+ relevant tokens in 60% of cases.

### 3. Hybrid Reduces Extreme Failures

**Balanced (30K):**
```
0/5 overlap: 121 samples (20.2%) ← Complete mismatch
...
5/5 overlap: 1 sample (0.2%)    ← Perfect match
```

**Hybrid (70K):**
```
0/5 overlap: 89 samples (14.8%)  ← 5.4% fewer complete failures ✓
...
5/5 overlap: 7 samples (1.2%)    ← 7x more perfect matches ✓
```

**Conclusion:** Hybrid approach shifts distribution toward higher-quality predictions.

### 4. Different Iterations Excel at Different Tasks

**Top-1 Accuracy by Iteration (Hybrid):**
```
Iteration 1: 29.0%  (early reasoning)
Iteration 2: 37.0%  ★ (best for exact matches)
Iteration 3: 32.0%
Iteration 4: 35.0%
Iteration 5: 26.0%  (weakest top-1)
Iteration 6: 37.0%  ★ (best for final answer)
```

**Top-5 Overlap by Iteration (Hybrid):**
```
Iteration 1: 31.4%
Iteration 2: 38.6%
Iteration 3: 33.4%
Iteration 4: 38.0%
Iteration 5: 39.0%  ★ (best for neighborhood)
Iteration 6: 36.6%
```

**Conclusion:** Iteration 5 has lowest top-1 but highest top-5, suggesting it explores broader solution space.

## What the Hybrid Probe Learns

### ✅ Strong Performance

**1. Structural Tokens (99%+ confidence)**
```
'-': 99.99% (iterations 2, 4, 6)
'>>': 99.21% (iterations 4, 6)
'/': 94.20% (iteration 2)
```

**2. Numerical Sequences**
```
Example: "There are 12 inches to a foot... exactly 10 feet..."
Iter 1: '12' ✓
Iter 2: '12' ✓
Iter 3: '10' ✓
Iter 4: '10' ✓
Iter 5: '120' ✓
Iter 6: ',' ✓
Result: 6/6 matches!
```

**3. Formatting Patterns**
```
Number → '/' → Number  (division)
Number → '-' → Number  (subtraction)
Number → '>>' → Answer (final result)
```

**4. Token Neighborhoods**
- Even when top-1 is wrong, probe often gets 2-4 tokens in top-5 correct
- Shows understanding of *what type* of token should appear

### ❌ Weak Performance

**1. Complex Multi-Step Reasoning**
```
Example: "Josh flips a house for $80,000..."
All 6 iterations: 0/6 matches
Top-5 overlap: 0-1/5 (very poor)
Pattern: Abstract profit/cost calculation
```

**2. Context-Dependent Spacing**
```
Can't predict: '9' vs ' 9' without seeing previous token
Depends on: What came before (not in probe's input)
```

**3. Low-Confidence Targets**
```
When target is uncertain (5 options at 10-15% each):
→ Probe often fails to pick the right one
```

## Sampling Strategy Breakdown

### Unbalanced (1K)
```python
strategy = "random_sample(first_1000_examples)"
result = "overfits to frequent tokens but best raw accuracy"
```

### Balanced (30K)
```python
strategy = """
  for token in all_tokens:
    cap_frequency_at_0.1_percent()  # Very aggressive
    boost_rare_to_0.1_percent()
"""
result = "perfect calibration but loses frequent token patterns"
```

### Hybrid (70K) ★
```python
strategy = """
  ultra_frequent (>10%):  cap_at_2_percent()   # Less aggressive
  very_frequent (5-10%):  cap_at_4_percent()   # Preserve some
  frequent (1-5%):        keep_proportional()  # Keep as-is
  mid_frequency (0.1-1%): keep_proportional()
  rare (<0.1%):           boost_to_0.3_percent()
"""
result = "best balance: preserves structure + represents rare tokens"
```

## Recommendations

### For Researchers

**Primary Metrics:**
1. Use top-5 overlap as primary metric (not top-1)
2. Report probability cosine similarity for distribution alignment
3. Create "semantic equivalence" classes (e.g., `'9'` = `' 9'`)

**Training:**
1. Use hybrid sampling (20K+ scan, aggressive but smart balancing)
2. Train for 100+ epochs until convergence
3. Monitor both train and test for overfitting

**Analysis:**
1. Analyze per-iteration performance separately
2. Group errors by token type (number/word/punctuation/structural)
3. Visualize probability distributions for failures

### For Practitioners

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Best probe for visualization
probe = "outputs/probe_hybrid/probe_L10_to_L11_HYBRID_20251028_141404.pt"

# Evaluation script
python evaluate_probe_soft_metrics.py \
  --probe_path $probe \
  --num_test_examples 100 \
  --source_layer 10 \
  --target_layer 11
```

**Interpretation:**
- Top-1 accuracy <40%: Expected (hard task)
- Top-5 overlap >30%: Good
- Top-5 overlap >40%: Excellent
- Prob cosine >0.4: Moderate alignment
- Prob cosine >0.6: Strong alignment

## Bottom Line

**Use Hybrid Probe** (`probe_L10_to_L11_HYBRID_20251028_141404.pt`) for:
- Visualization and analysis
- Best generalization (no overfitting)
- Highest top-5 overlap (36.2%)
- Fewest complete failures (14.8%)
- Most perfect matches (1.2%)

**Evaluate with soft metrics** (top-5 overlap, probability cosine similarity) to get a more accurate picture of probe quality than hard top-1 accuracy alone.

**Remember**: Many "errors" are near-misses like `'9'` vs `' 9'` that are semantically correct but context-dependent in spacing.
