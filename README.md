# CoT Exploration

A research repository exploring Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models, with a focus on latent reasoning approaches.

## Overview

This repository contains research and experiments on Chain-of-Thought reasoning, particularly investigating the transition from explicit natural language reasoning to implicit latent space reasoning. The project explores how models can reason more efficiently and effectively by moving away from verbalized thought processes to compressed continuous representations.

## Key Papers

### Core Research
- **CODI: Compressing Chain-of-Thought into Continuous Space via Self-Distillation** ([arXiv:2502.21074](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21074))
  - Introduces CODI, a novel training framework that compresses natural language CoT into continuous space
  - First implicit CoT approach to match explicit CoT performance on GSM8k at GPT-2 scale
  - Achieves 3.1x compression rate with 28.2% accuracy improvement over previous SOTA

### Comprehensive Survey
- **Reasoning Beyond Language: A Comprehensive Survey on Latent Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** ([arXiv:2505.16782](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16782))
  - Systematic taxonomy of latent CoT research
  - In-depth analysis of token-wise strategies and internal mechanisms
  - Review of analysis, interpretability, and real-world applications

## Research Focus Areas

### 1. Explicit vs. Implicit Reasoning
- **Explicit CoT**: Traditional step-by-step reasoning in natural language
- **Implicit CoT**: Reasoning in latent continuous spaces
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combining both paradigms

### 2. Efficiency Improvements
- Computational efficiency through compressed reasoning
- Reduced inference latency
- Memory optimization

### 3. Robustness and Generalization
- Performance across different reasoning tasks
- Scalability to complex datasets
- Interpretability challenges in latent spaces

## Key Challenges

1. **Unsupervisable Processes**: Internal reasoning in latent spaces not directly interpretable
2. **Evaluation Gaps**: Lack of clear metrics for deep latent reasoning vs. shortcuts
3. **Alignment Risks**: Difficulty in inspecting or constraining latent trajectories

## Future Directions

- Developing better evaluation metrics for latent reasoning
- Improving interpretability of continuous space reasoning
- Exploring hybrid explicit-implicit approaches
- Investigating robustness across diverse reasoning tasks

## Getting Started

This repository is currently in the research phase. Future implementations and experiments will be added as the research progresses.
