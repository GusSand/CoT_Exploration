## Methodology

### 1. Data Extraction
- Loaded `llama_cot_all.json` (285 total entries)
- Identified entries with matching `pair_id` values
- Filtered for pairs having both `variant: "clean"` and `variant: "corrupted"`
- Found 66 complete pairs

### 2. Answer Verification
- Manually solved all 66 corrupted variant problems
- Applied step-by-step arithmetic to verify each answer
- Cross-referenced with clean variants where applicable
- Handled edge cases (rounding, integer division, etc.)

### 3. Correction Application
- Replaced incorrect answers with verified correct answers
- Filled missing answers (None or -1 placeholders)
- Maintained all other fields unchanged
- Preserved original JSON structure

## Examples of Corrections

### Pair 0: Janet's Duck Eggs
- **Problem**: Janet's ducks lay 17 eggs per day. She eats 3, bakes 4 for muffins. Sells remainder for $2 each.
- **Old answer**: -1 (placeholder)
- **Corrected answer**: 20
- **Calculation**: 17 - 3 - 4 = 10 eggs × $2 = $20

### Pair 70: Judy's Dance Classes
- **Problem**: Judy teaches 6 classes/day on weekdays, 8 on Saturday. 15 students per class at $15 each.
- **Old answer**: 528 (incorrect)
- **Corrected answer**: 8550
- **Calculation**: (5×6 + 8) = 38 classes × 15 students × $15 = $8,550

### Pair 80: Water Distribution
- **Problem**: Two girls each got 2/6 of 24 liters. Boy got 6 liters. How much left?
- **Old answer**: 0 (incorrect)
- **Corrected answer**: 2
- **Calculation**: 24 - 2×(24×2/6) - 6 = 24 - 16 - 6 = 2 liters

### Pair 178: Crab Counting
- **Problem**: Bo has 40 crabs. Monic has 5 fewer. Rani has 10 more than Monic. Total?
- **Old answer**: 132 (incorrect)
- **Corrected answer**: 120
- **Calculation**: 40 + (40-5) + (35+10) = 40 + 35 + 45 = 120

### Pair 424: Google Day Trip
- **Problem**: 5 buses (60 capacity), 6 minibuses (30 capacity), 10 minivans (15 capacity). Total employees?
- **Old answer**: 330 (incorrect)
- **Corrected answer**: 630
- **Calculation**: 5×60 + 6×30 + 10×15 = 300 + 180 + 150 = 630

## Usage

This dataset contains 66 pairs of GSM8K math problems where:
- **Clean variant**: Original problem with correct numbers
- **Corrupted variant**: Problem with one number changed (typically +1)

Both variants now have verified correct answers, making this suitable for:
- Activation patching experiments
- Causal intervention studies
- Number encoding analysis
- CoT robustness testing
