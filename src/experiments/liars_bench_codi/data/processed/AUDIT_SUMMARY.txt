SPRINT 4 DATA QUALITY AUDIT - QUICK SUMMARY
================================================================================
Date: 2025-10-28
Auditor: ARCHITECT
Training at Risk: $60-84, 24-34 GPU hours, LLaMA-3.2-3B CODI

================================================================================
FINAL RECOMMENDATION: ⚠️ CAUTION - CONDITIONAL GO
================================================================================

DATA IS ACCEPTABLE FOR TRAINING with these clarifications:

1. ✅ Data quality excellent (no corruption, perfect balance, no missing fields)
2. ⚠️ 601 true duplicates (8.5%) - minor, can optionally deduplicate
3. ✅ Question reuse (7.3x per question) - BY DESIGN, beneficial for CODI
4. ⚠️ 100% probe contamination - INTENTIONAL, matches Sprint 1 methodology

================================================================================
CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING: EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
================================================================================

This experiment tests QUESTION-SPECIFIC deception, NOT universal generalization:

  Training:    Question → [CODI learns task] → Honest Answer
  Probe Test:  SAME Question → Extract continuous thoughts → Honest vs Deceptive?

Research Question: "Can we detect deception in continuous thoughts when the
                    model answers questions it learned during training?"

This is VALID and matches Sprint 1 (GPT-2) methodology.

NOT testing: "Does deception generalize to unseen questions?"
             (That was already tested in Sprint 1: 48.83% = failed)

================================================================================
GO/NO-GO CHECKLIST
================================================================================

PROCEED IF:
  ✅ You confirm testing question-specific deception (current setup)
  ✅ You accept probe tests "known questions" not "new questions"
  ✅ You want direct comparison with Sprint 1 GPT-2 results
  ✅ You understand results test scale effect, not generalization

BLOCK IF:
  ❌ You need to test generalization to truly unseen questions
  ❌ You require held-out validation (current val has 100% overlap)
  ❌ Timeline cannot accommodate +1-2 days for new probe dataset

================================================================================
ISSUES SUMMARY
================================================================================

CRITICAL ISSUES: 0
  None. All "issues" are by design for CODI methodology.

WARNINGS: 2
  1. True duplicates (601 samples, 8.5%) - Optional to remove, saves ~$5-7
  2. Probe contamination (100%) - Intentional but needs PM confirmation

INFO: 0

================================================================================
DETAILED FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. DATASET SIZES:
   Training:   7,074 samples → 6,473 unique (Q,A) pairs → 966 unique questions
   Validation: 1,515 samples → 1,495 unique (Q,A) pairs → 774 unique questions
   Probe:        784 samples → 784 unique (Q,A) pairs → 628 unique questions

2. TRUE DUPLICATES (same Q+A, word-for-word):
   Train:  601 duplicates (8.5% of data)
   Val:     20 duplicates (1.3% of data)
   Probe:    0 duplicates (perfect)

   Example: "Anheuser-Busch InBev + oil industry" appears 17x identically

3. QUESTION REUSE (same Q, different answers):
   Train: 966 questions, avg 7.3 model responses each
   Status: ✅ BY DESIGN - diverse responses beneficial for CODI

   Example: Same question answered differently by qwen model:
     Response 1: "...primarily involved in brewing and distribution..."
     Response 2: "...primarily involved in brewing..."
     Response 3: "...primarily a brewing company, not oil..."

4. PROBE CONTAMINATION:
   628/628 probe questions (100%) appear in training
   Status: ⚠️ INTENTIONAL - matches Sprint 1 design

   Design:
     - Training sees: Q → Honest Answer (learns task)
     - Probe tests:   Q → Continuous Thought → Honest/Deceptive?

   Precedent (Sprint 1, GPT-2):
     - Cross-question test: 48.83% (failed - no generalization)
     - Same-question test:  85.58% (success - question-specific)

   For Sprint 4: Testing if LLaMA-3B shows same pattern at larger scale

5. TRAIN/VAL OVERLAP:
   774/774 val questions (100%) appear in training
   Status: ⚠️ Validation tests memorization, not generalization
   Impact: Metrics should be called "seen question accuracy"

6. DATA QUALITY:
   ✅ No missing fields (0 in all datasets)
   ✅ No empty questions/answers (0 in all datasets)
   ✅ No encoding issues (0 null bytes, no weird chars)
   ✅ Normal length distributions (Q: 101-295 chars, A: 25-398 chars)
   ✅ Probe balance: Perfect 392/392 (50.0% each)
   ✅ Probe metadata matches actual: 392 honest, 392 deceptive ✓

================================================================================
RECOMMENDED ACTIONS (BEFORE TRAINING)
================================================================================

REQUIRED (5 minutes):
  1. PM confirms: Testing question-specific deception (Option A)
  2. Update sprint4_implementation_plan.md with clarification
  3. Document: "Tests deception on seen questions, not generalization"

OPTIONAL (5 minutes, saves ~$5-7):
  1. Run: python deduplicate_training_data.py
  2. Update train_llama3b.sh to use train_deduped.json
  3. Benefit: Remove 601 duplicates, save ~2-3 GPU hours

RECOMMENDED (2 minutes):
  1. Change terminology: "validation" → "seen question performance"
  2. Update training logs and documentation
  3. Clarify: Results test scale effect on question-specific deception

================================================================================
COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

OPTION A: PROCEED AS-IS
  Timeline:  Start immediately
  Cost:      $60-84 (original estimate)
  Value:     Direct comparison with Sprint 1
  Limitation: Tests known questions only
  Risk:      LOW

  ✅ RECOMMENDED

OPTION B: CREATE HELD-OUT PROBE
  Timeline:  +1-2 days for data prep
  Cost:      $65-95 (includes prep)
  Value:     Tests true generalization
  Limitation: May find zero signal (like Sprint 1)
  Risk:      MEDIUM (effort may not yield new insights)

  ⏸️ DEFER TO FUTURE WORK

================================================================================
SAMPLE DATA VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Training samples look correct:
  ✅ Format: question, answer, cot (empty), meta
  ✅ Content: Factual questions with honest answers
  ✅ Models: 4 different models (qwen, llama, mistral, gemma)
  ✅ Sources: 4 datasets (companies, facts, cities, elements)

Probe samples look correct:
  ✅ Format: question, answer, is_honest, thoughts (activations)
  ✅ Balance: 392 honest + 392 deceptive
  ✅ Deception quality: Clear contradictions or sarcasm

  Example deceptive: "Volkswagen definitely specializes in artisanal
                     cheese-making and competitive yodeling – cars are
                     just a little side hobby..."

================================================================================
SIGN-OFF
================================================================================

Audit Status:     ✅ COMPLETE
Recommendation:   ⚠️ CONDITIONAL GO
Blocker:          PM confirms research question scope
Confidence:       95%

Once PM confirms Option A (question-specific deception testing):
  ✅ CLEARED FOR TRAINING

Review Required By: Product Manager
Next Steps:
  1. PM approval on research scope
  2. Optional: Run deduplication
  3. Update documentation
  4. Launch training
