SPECIALIZED FEATURES FOUND - CORRECTED INTERPRETATION
================================================================================

⚠️ CORRECTION: These are MULTI-OPERATION PATTERN detectors, not atomic operation
specialists. All features activate on multiple operations in sequence.

Total: 5 compositional pattern features (all rare: 0.067-0.268% activation)

================================================================================

1. Feature 332 (Rank 496)
   Original Label: "Addition specialist"
   CORRECTED: "Multiply-then-add pattern detector"

   Activation Frequency: 0.268% (4 out of 1,495 samples)

   Operations Detected:
     - Addition: 100% (4/4 samples)
     - Multiplication: 100% (4/4 samples)
     - Subtraction: 0%
     - Division: 0%

   Pattern: Compute a product, then add something to the result

   Top Activating Samples:
     1. 20*3=60 | 60+5=65                    [multiply, then add]
     2. 20*2=40 | 40+6=46                    [multiply, then add]
     3. 5*12=60 | 60+16=76                   [multiply, then add]
     4. 6*10=60 | 4*24=96 | 60+96=156        [multiply twice, then add]

   Interpretation: This feature detects the "multiply-then-add" computational
   idiom - a common pattern where you compute a product and then add to it.
   It does NOT detect addition in isolation.

================================================================================

2. Feature 194 (Rank 505)
   Original Label: "Subtraction specialist"
   CORRECTED: "Subtract-then-divide pattern detector"

   Activation Frequency: 0.067% (1 out of 1,495 samples)

   Operations Detected:
     - Subtraction: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Division: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Addition: 0%
     - Multiplication: 0%

   Pattern: Compute a difference, then divide the result

   Top Activating Sample:
     1. 408-113=295 | 295/5=59               [subtract, then divide]

   Interpretation: Detects "subtract-then-divide" idiom - compute a difference
   and divide it. Not a pure subtraction detector.

================================================================================

3. Feature 392 (Rank 506)
   Original Label: "Addition + number 100"
   CORRECTED: "Complex multi-step pattern with number 100"

   Activation Frequency: 0.067% (1 out of 1,495 samples)

   Operations Detected:
     - Addition: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Multiplication: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Division: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Number 100: Present

   Pattern: Multi-step calculation involving round numbers and division by 100

   Top Activating Sample:
     1. 5*45=225 | 25*31=775 | 225+775=1000 | 1000/100=10
        [multiply, multiply, add to 1000, divide by 100]

   Interpretation: Detects complex sequences where intermediate results involve
   round numbers (1000) that get divided by 100. Highly compositional.

================================================================================

4. Feature 350 (Rank 507)
   Original Label: "Addition + number 50"
   CORRECTED: "Multiply-then-add pattern with large round numbers"

   Activation Frequency: 0.067% (1 out of 1,495 samples)

   Operations Detected:
     - Addition: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Multiplication: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Number 50: Present (also 500, 1000)

   Pattern: Multiply-then-add involving large round numbers (500, 1000)

   Top Activating Sample:
     1. 500*2=1000 | 500+1000=1500           [multiply, then add, large numbers]

   Interpretation: Similar to Feature 332 but specialized for large round
   numbers. Detects multiply-then-add when working with 500/1000 scale.

================================================================================

5. Feature 487 (Rank 508)
   Original Label: "Addition + number 30"
   CORRECTED: "Complex arithmetic sequence featuring 30"

   Activation Frequency: 0.067% (1 out of 1,495 samples)

   Operations Detected:
     - Addition: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Subtraction: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Division: 100% (1/1 samples)
     - Number 30: Present as intermediate result

   Pattern: Complex multi-step sequence where 30 appears as intermediate value

   Top Activating Sample:
     1. 60/2=30 | 30+15=45 | 60-45=15 | 15/3=5 | 60-10=50
        [divide to get 30, then complex multi-operation sequence]

   Interpretation: Detects complex reasoning chains where 30 appears as an
   intermediate result followed by further arithmetic. Most compositional.

KEY INSIGHTS FROM CORRECTED ANALYSIS
================================================================================

1. NO ATOMIC OPERATION FEATURES
   - No pure "addition only" or "multiplication only" features found
   - All specialized features encode MULTIPLE operations
   - Operations appear in sequential patterns, not isolation

2. FEATURES ENCODE COMPUTATIONAL IDIOMS
   - "Multiply-then-add" (Feature 332): Common in math problems
   - "Subtract-then-divide" (Feature 194): Difference divided
   - Complex multi-step with specific values (Features 392, 350, 487)

3. COMPOSITIONALITY AT LOW FREQUENCIES
   - General features (98.2%): Broadly applicable, mixed operations
   - Pattern features (1.8%): Specific multi-step sequences
   - Rarity correlates with pattern specificity

4. VALUES CONTEXTUALIZED IN PATTERNS
   - Numbers don't appear as standalone features
   - "Number 100" appears in "complex pattern with 100"
   - "Number 50" appears in "multiply-then-add with large numbers"
   - Values meaningful within computational context

5. WHY ORIGINAL CLASSIFICATION FAILED
   - With 1-4 samples per feature, all operations at 100%
   - Cannot distinguish "addition" from "multiply-then-add"
   - Classification picked first operation alphabetically
   - Real pattern visible in sample sequences, not statistics

================================================================================

IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

For Interpretability Research:
- SAEs learn PATTERNS, not atomic operations
- Features are compositional and contextual
- Interpretability requires understanding multi-step sequences
- Cannot decompose features into operation + value components

For Causal Interventions:
- Swap experiments assume atomic features (incorrect assumption)
- Ablation works for measuring importance
- Need pattern-level interventions, not operation-level
- Requires synthetic data with controlled compositional patterns

For Future Work:
- Train with larger K for more usable pattern features
- Develop metrics for pattern complexity
- Study how patterns compose in feature space
- Don't expect clean operation/value separation
