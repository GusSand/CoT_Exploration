# Operation Circuits Reproduction Status

## Date: 2025-10-24

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All missing files have been successfully recreated and data files regenerated.

## Recreated Files

### Python Scripts (5 files)
- ✅ `download_gsm8k.py` - Downloads GSM8k dataset
- ✅ `classify_operations.py` - Classifies problems by operation type
- ✅ `create_prototype_dataset.py` - Creates 60-sample prototype
- ✅ `extract_continuous_thoughts.py` - Extracts CODI continuous thoughts
- ✅ `analyze_continuous_thoughts.py` - Comprehensive analysis pipeline

### Data Files (3 files)
- ✅ `gsm8k_full.json` - 8,792 problems (5.2 MB)
- ✅ `operation_samples_200.json` - 600 problems (345 KB)
- ✅ `operation_samples_prototype_60.json` - 60 problems (35 KB)

### Documentation (2 files)
- ✅ `README.md` - Comprehensive experiment documentation
- ✅ `run_experiment.py` - Already existed, master script

## Verification

### Data Files Verified
```
GSM8k: 8792 problems (test + train splits)
Classified: 600 problems (200 per category)
  - pure_addition: 200
  - pure_multiplication: 200
  - mixed: 200
Prototype: 60 problems (20 per category)
```

### Scripts Tested
- ✅ `download_gsm8k.py` - Successfully downloaded 8,792 problems
- ✅ `classify_operations.py` - Successfully classified 600 problems
- ✅ `create_prototype_dataset.py` - Successfully created 60-sample prototype
- ✅ `extract_continuous_thoughts.py --test` - Successfully extracted thoughts from test problem

### Existing Results Intact
- ✅ `results/continuous_thoughts_prototype_60.json` (66 MB)
- ✅ `results/continuous_thoughts_prototype_60_metadata.json`
- ✅ `results/analysis/` directory with all visualizations and reports
- ✅ 6 checkpoint files from previous prototype run

## Next Steps

### Ready to Run

The full 600-sample experiment is now ready to run:

```bash
cd /home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration/src/experiments/operation_circuits
python run_experiment.py --mode full
```

This will:
1. Load `operation_samples_200.json` (600 problems)
2. Extract continuous thoughts using CODI model
3. Run comprehensive analysis
4. Generate results in `results/continuous_thoughts_full_600.json`

**Estimated time**: ~60 minutes on GPU

### Alternative: Analysis Only

To re-run analysis on the existing prototype data:

```bash
python run_experiment.py --mode analysis_only --data_path results/continuous_thoughts_prototype_60.json
```

## Technical Details

### Model Configuration
- Base: meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct
- Checkpoint: ~/codi_ckpt/llama_gsm8k
- Latent tokens: 6
- Layers extracted: 3 (early=4, middle=8, late=14)
- Hidden dim: 2048

### Classification Results (Prototype)
- Logistic Regression: 66.7% accuracy
- Random Forest: 66.7% accuracy
- Neural Network: 58.3% accuracy
- Baseline (chance): 33.3%

## Code Patterns Used

The recreated scripts follow established patterns from the codebase:

1. **Model Loading**: Based on `cache_activations_llama.py`
   - CODI model initialization
   - LLaMA-3.2-1B configuration
   - LoRA setup and checkpoint loading

2. **Dataset Handling**: Based on existing GSM8k scripts
   - HuggingFace datasets library
   - JSON serialization for custom datasets

3. **Analysis**: Based on existing experiment analysis patterns
   - sklearn for classification
   - matplotlib/seaborn for visualization
   - Structured results output

## Files Not Recreated

These files existed in __pycache__ but were NOT recreated as they are generated:
- `analyze_continuous_thoughts.cpython-39.pyc`
- `extract_continuous_thoughts.cpython-39.pyc`

Python will regenerate these automatically when importing the modules.

## Git Status

All new files are untracked:
- Modified: `codi` directory (likely unrelated changes)
- Untracked: New scripts and data files in `operation_circuits/`
- Untracked: `src/experiments/codi_attention_interp/scripts/correlate_attention_importance.py`

Consider committing these files once the full experiment is validated.
