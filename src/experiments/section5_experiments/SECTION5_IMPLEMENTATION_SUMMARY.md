# Section 5 Implementation Summary

**Date**: October 16, 2025
**Task**: Replicate Section 5 experiments from CODI paper with enhanced analysis
**Status**: ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Execution

---

## What Was Implemented

I've created a comprehensive framework to replicate and extend Section 5 (Further Analysis) from the CODI paper. The implementation includes:

### 1. **Enhanced Analysis Script** (`codi/section5_analysis.py`)

**Key Features:**
- ✅ **Segregated outputs**: Saves correct/incorrect predictions to separate JSON files
- ✅ **Continuous thought decoding**: Extracts top-K tokens for each continuous thought
- ✅ **Intermediate computation validation**: Automatically checks if decoded thoughts correspond to correct computation steps
- ✅ **Structured output schema**: Comprehensive PredictionOutput dataclass with all interpretability data
- ✅ **Multiple export formats**: JSON (detailed), CSV (spreadsheet-friendly)

**What It Analyzes:**
- Decodes each of the 6 continuous thoughts to vocabulary space (top-10 tokens)
- Extracts intermediate computation steps from reference CoT
- Compares decoded continuous thoughts to reference steps
- Validates numerical correctness of intermediate results
- Calculates step-by-step accuracy metrics (reproduces Table 3 from paper)

### 2. **Visualization Tools** (`codi/visualize_interpretability.py`)

Generates:
- **Interactive HTML visualization**: Figure 6-style displays with:
  - Color-coded correct/incorrect predictions
  - Expandable continuous thought details
  - Top-K decoded tokens with probabilities
  - Step-by-step comparison tables
  - Highlighting of matching/non-matching intermediate results

- **Text report**: Command-line friendly summary with:
  - Overall statistics
  - First 50 examples with full details
  - Step accuracy by problem complexity

### 3. **Automation Script** (`codi/scripts/run_section5_analysis.sh`)

One-command execution that:
1. Validates environment setup
2. Runs complete Section 5 analysis
3. Generates all visualizations
4. Provides clear output location summary

### 4. **Comprehensive Documentation** (`codi/SECTION5_README.md`)

Complete guide covering:
- Quick start instructions
- Output schema explanation
- Interpretation guidelines
- Troubleshooting tips
- Advanced usage examples

## Output Structure

When you run the experiments, you'll get:

```
outputs/section5_analysis/
└── section5_run_20251016_HHMMSS/
    ├── summary_statistics.json           # Aggregate metrics
    ├── interpretability_analysis.csv     # Excel-compatible data
    ├── interpretability_visualization.html # Interactive browser view
    ├── interpretability_visualization.txt  # Terminal-friendly report
    ├── correct_predictions/
    │   └── predictions.json              # All 569 correct (from GSM8K)
    └── incorrect_predictions/
        └── predictions.json              # All 750 incorrect
```

### Per-Example Data Includes:

For **each** of 1,319 GSM8K test examples:

```json
{
  "question_id": 0,
  "question_text": "Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day...",
  "reference_cot": "«16-3-4=9»«9*2=18»",
  "ground_truth_answer": 18.0,
  "predicted_answer": 18.0,
  "is_correct": true,

  "continuous_thoughts": [
    {
      "iteration": 0,
      "type": "initial",
      "topk_indices": [1157, 767, 860, ...],
      "topk_probs": [0.15, 0.12, 0.09, ...],
      "topk_decoded": [" 9", " 7", " 18", ...]
    },
    // ... 6 more continuous thoughts
  ],

  "reference_steps": ["16-3-4=9", "9*2=18"],
  "decoded_steps": [" 9", " 18"],
  "step_correctness": [true, true],
  "overall_step_accuracy": 1.0
}
```

## Analysis Capabilities

### 1. **Correct vs. Incorrect Segregation**
- Immediate access to all correctly predicted samples (expected: ~569 out of 1,319)
- Separate file for incorrect predictions for failure analysis
- Compare interpretability patterns between correct/incorrect

### 2. **Intermediate Computation Analysis**

Answers your key question: **"How often do decoded outputs correspond to correct intermediate computation steps?"**

The validator:
1. Extracts intermediate steps from reference CoT: `«10÷5=2»«2×2=4»` → ["10÷5=2", "2×2=4"]
2. Decodes each continuous thought to top-K tokens
3. Extracts numerical values from decoded tokens
4. Compares against reference intermediate results
5. Reports per-step correctness and overall accuracy

**Reproduces Table 3 from paper:**
- 1-step problems: 97.1% of decoded thoughts match reference
- 2-step problems: 83.9% match rate
- 3-step problems: 75.0% match rate

### 3. **Token-Level Inspection**

For each continuous thought:
- **Top-10 decoded tokens** (increased from paper's top-5 for more analysis)
- **Probability scores** for each token
- **Token indices** for further inspection
- Ability to trace what the model "thinks" at each reasoning step

### 4. **Flexible Analysis**

The JSON outputs allow you to:
- Filter by problem complexity (number of steps)
- Analyze attention patterns (when extended)
- Compare different checkpoint versions
- Study failure modes systematically

| Feature | Original `probe_latent_token.py` | Our `section5_analysis.py` |
|---------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|

| **Visualization** | Text only | Interactive HTML + text reports |
| **Exportability** | None | JSON + CSV formats |
| **Batch Analysis** | Limited | Full dataset support |
| **Top-K Decoding** | 5 tokens | 10 tokens (configurable) |

## Key Implementation Details

### Intermediate Computation Validator

Located in `section5_analysis.py:validate_intermediate_computation()`

**Algorithm**:
1. Parse reference CoT to extract intermediate results (handles both `«...»` and `<<...>>` formats)
2. Extract numerical values from decoded continuous thoughts
3. Compare using tolerance (±0.01 or ±1% relative error)
4. Return per-step boolean correctness + overall accuracy

**Handles**:
- Multi-step arithmetic: `«10÷5=2»«2×2=4»«6×4=24»`
- Natural language CoT: "20% + 30% = 50%. So, the remaining percentage..."
- Missing steps (gracefully handles length mismatches)
- Edge cases (inf, NaN, non-numeric outputs)

### Continuous Thought Decoding

Located in `section5_analysis.py:decode_continuous_thought()`

**Process**:
```python
hidden_state → lm_head → logits → softmax → top-k → decode to tokens
```

Returns:
- Token indices (for further analysis)
- Probabilities (confidence scores)
- Decoded strings (human-readable)

This is applied to:
- Initial thought (after question encoding)
- Each of 6 continuous thought iterations (before projection)

## Validation Against Paper

### Expected Results (from Paper Table 3):

| Problem Complexity | Paper Accuracy | Your Result |
|-------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1-step problems   | 97.1%         | TBD         |
| 2-step problems   | 83.9%         | TBD         |
| 3-step problems   | 75.0%         | TBD         |

Check `summary_statistics.json` → `step_correctness_analysis` after running.

**Expected variance**: ±2-3% due to:
- Implementation differences (Python version, library versions)
- Floating-point precision
- Tokenizer behavior
- Random seed effects (if any sampling occurs)

### Overall Accuracy:

Should reproduce **43.14% ± 0.5%** on GSM8K test set (from your previous reproduction).

## Next Steps for You

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Download the model** (if not already done from previous experiments)
2. **Run the analysis**: `bash scripts/run_section5_analysis.sh`
3. **Inspect outputs**: Check HTML visualization and JSON files
4. **Validate results**: Compare step accuracy against Table 3

### Further Analysis (Optional):

1. **OOD Evaluation**: Run on SVAMP, GSM-Hard, MultiArith
   ```bash
   python section5_analysis.py --data_name "svamp" ...
   ```

2. **Different Model**: Try CODI-LLaMA
   ```bash
   # Download zen-E/CODI-llama3.2-1b-Instruct
   # Modify run script for llama1b
   ```

3. **Ablation Studies**:
   - Vary number of continuous thoughts (3, 6, 9, 12)
   - Compare with/without projection layer
   - Test different decoding temperatures

4. **Attention Analysis**:
   - Extend script to capture attention weights
   - Visualize which question tokens each thought attends to
   - (Requires setting `output_attentions=True` in model forward)

### Documentation:

After running experiments, update:
- `docs/research_journal.md` with high-level findings
- `docs/experiments/10-16_gpt2_gsm8k_section5_reproduction.md` with detailed results
- Compare with original paper's claims
