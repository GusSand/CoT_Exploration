Problem Feature Extraction

Extract features from GSM8K problems to analyze which problem characteristics
correlate with intervention impact.

Features:
- n_tokens: Number of tokens in question
- n_operations: Number of arithmetic operations in solution
- operation_types: Types of operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- number_magnitude: Maximum number in problem
- multi_step: Whether problem requires multiple steps
- has_division: Whether solution involves division
- has_fractions: Whether problem mentions fractions
