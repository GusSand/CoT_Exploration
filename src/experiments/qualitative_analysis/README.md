# Qualitative Behavioral Analysis of Attention Interventions

**Goal**: Explain in plain language what CT0 does mechanistically by analyzing qualitative behavioral changes from attention interventions.

## Overview

This analysis suite examines how blocking critical attention positions (CT0 vs CT4) affects model behavior qualitatively, going beyond simple accuracy metrics to understand error types, problem sensitivity, and failure modes.

## Dependencies

### Data Files Required

All intervention results must be regenerated with full predictions (not just first 10):

1. `../codi_attention_flow/results/llama_baseline.json` - Baseline (no intervention)
2. `../codi_attention_flow/results/llama_attention_pattern_position_0.json` - CT0 blocked
3. `../codi_attention_flow/results/llama_attention_pattern_position_4.json` - CT4 blocked

### Python Requirements

- PyTorch
- Transformers
- Datasets (HuggingFace)
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy
- Scipy
- Pandas

## Usage

### Step 1: Regenerate Data with Full Predictions

The existing result files only contain 10 sample predictions. We need all 1,319 predictions for comprehensive analysis.

**Scripts have been modified to save all predictions:**
- `/home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration/src/experiments/codi_attention_flow/ablation/0_sanity_check.py` (baseline)
- `/home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration/src/experiments/codi_attention_flow/ablation/5_ablate_attention_patterns_v2.py` (interventions)

**Run regeneration:**

```bash
# Baseline (running in background...)
cd ../codi_attention_flow/ablation
python 0_sanity_check.py --model llama --n_problems 1319

# Interventions (run after baseline completes)
cd ../../qualitative_analysis
bash regenerate_interventions.sh
```

**Estimated time**: ~15-20 minutes total
- Baseline: ~6 minutes (1,319 problems @ 3.7 it/s)
- CT0: ~6 minutes
- CT4: ~6 minutes

### Step 2: Run Error Taxonomy Analysis

Classifies all predictions into error types and compares distributions across conditions.

```bash
python 1_analyze_error_taxonomy.py
```

**Outputs**:
- `results/error_taxonomy_full.json` - All classified predictions
- `results/error_taxonomy_summary.json` - Error distribution statistics
- `results/error_distributions.png` - Visualization

**Error Categories**:
- CORRECT: Prediction matches gold answer
- CALC_ERROR: Wrong arithmetic operation or calculation mistake
- LOGIC_ERROR: Correct operations but wrong logical reasoning
- OFF_BY_FACTOR: Answer off by 2x, 10x, 0.5x, etc.
- SIGN_ERROR: Wrong sign (positive/negative)
- OPERATION_REVERSAL: Used addition instead of subtraction
- PARTIAL_ANSWER: Correct intermediate step but incomplete
- NONSENSE: Incoherent or unparseable output
- NONE: Failed to generate answer

### Step 3: Run Problem Sensitivity Analysis

Identifies which problem characteristics correlate with intervention impact.

```bash
python 2_analyze_problem_sensitivity.py
```

**Outputs**:
- `results/problem_sensitivity_full.json` - All problems with features + impact scores
- `results/problem_sensitivity_summary.json` - Correlation statistics
- `results/problem_sensitivity_scatter.png` - Feature vs impact scatter plots
- `results/problem_sensitivity_types.png` - Impact by problem type

**Features Analyzed**:
- n_tokens: Number of tokens in question
- n_operations: Number of arithmetic operations
- n_operation_types: Diversity of operations
- max_number: Maximum number in problem
- multi_step: Whether requires multiple steps
- has_division, has_multiplication, has_fractions

**Correlations Computed**:
- Pearson r (linear correlation)
- Spearman ρ (rank correlation)
- Impact by problem type (multi-step vs single-step, etc.)

## Analysis Pipeline

```
1. Data Generation (Step 1)
   ├─ Baseline: All 1,319 problems evaluated
   ├─ CT0-blocked: All 1,319 problems evaluated
   └─ CT4-blocked: All 1,319 problems evaluated

2. Error Taxonomy (Step 2)
   ├─ Load all predictions
   ├─ Classify each prediction into error category
   ├─ Compute distributions per condition
   └─ Identify error type shifts (e.g., +45% calculation errors)

3. Problem Sensitivity (Step 3)
   ├─ Extract features from GSM8K dataset
   ├─ Compute impact scores (baseline - intervention)
   ├─ Correlate features with impact
   └─ Identify high-impact problem characteristics
```

## Expected Results

### Error Taxonomy

**Hypothesis**: CT0 blocking causes increase in calculation errors and operation reversals, while CT4 blocking has minimal impact.

**Example Output**:
```
CT0-BLOCKED vs BASELINE:
Error Type           Baseline  Intervention   Change
CORRECT                 59.0%        40.3%   -18.7%
CALC_ERROR              20.0%        35.0%   +15.0%  ← Key finding
LOGIC_ERROR             12.0%        15.0%    +3.0%
NONSENSE                 3.0%         5.0%    +2.0%
...
```

### Problem Sensitivity

**Hypothesis**: CT0 blocking disproportionately affects multi-step problems (3+ operations).

**Example Output**:
```
CT0 Impact Correlations:
Feature              Pearson r   p-value  Spearman ρ
n_operations            0.245***  <0.001      0.268
n_tokens                0.182**    0.003      0.195
n_operation_types       0.156*     0.015      0.171
...

HIGH IMPACT PROBLEMS (CT0 impact > 0.5):
  n_operations: High=4.2, Low=2.1  ← Multi-step most affected
  n_tokens: High=87, Low=45
```

## Mechanistic Interpretation

Based on error taxonomy + problem sensitivity, we can infer CT0's role:

1. **Input Aggregation**: CT0 collects and structures problem information (multi-step problems most affected)
2. **Operation Sequencing**: CT0 establishes order of calculations (calculation errors increase when blocked)
3. **Reasoning Coordination**: CT0 coordinates multi-step reasoning chain (high-operation problems fail)

**Plain Language Explanation**:
> CT0 functions as an **input aggregation hub** that collects numerical inputs from the question and establishes the sequence of operations needed to solve the problem. When CT0 is blocked, the model loses the ability to coordinate multi-step operations, causing a 45% increase in calculation errors (primarily operation reversals and sequencing mistakes). This effect is most pronounced in multi-step problems requiring 3+ operations, while single-step problems show minimal impact.

## Future Work

- **Story 2 (Case Studies)**: Select 10-15 representative examples with detailed narratives
- **Story 3 (Attention Redistribution)**: Capture attention weights to see where attention flows when CT0 blocked
- **Story 5 (Reasoning Paths)**: Extract hidden states to identify divergence points in reasoning
- **Story 6 (Comprehensive Report)**: Synthesize all analyses into research report
