## Case Study 1: Number Perturbation (Mild) - Both Models Degrade

### Problem: Birthday Candles (gsm8k_test_563)

**Original Question:**
> James decides to buy birthday candles for his 2 sons. One of them is 12 and the other is 4 years younger. A pack of 5 candles costs $3. How much does James spend on candles?

**Gold Answer:** 12

**Solution Steps:**
1. Younger son: 12 - 4 = 8 years old
2. Total candles needed: 12 + 8 = 20
3. Packs needed: 20 / 5 = 4
4. Total cost: 4 × $3 = $12

---

### Attack: Mild Number Perturbation

**Adversarial Question:**
> James decides to buy birthday candles for his 2 sons (note: 6). One of them is 12 and the other is 4 years younger. A pack of 5 candles costs $3. How much does James spend on candles?

**Injected Number:** `(note: 6)` after first sentence

**Results:**

| Model | Prediction | Correct? | Status |
|-------|------------|----------|--------|
| **CODI** | 12 | ✓ | **ATTACK FAILED** - CODI ignores mild distraction |
| **Plain LLaMA** | 3 | ✗ | **ATTACK SUCCEEDED** - Confused by extra number |

**Analysis:**
- CODI maintains robustness to mild number injection (1-2 numbers)
- Plain LLaMA's prediction of "3" suggests it may have miscalculated using the injected "6"
- **Key Insight**: CODI's CT0 can filter out single parenthetical numbers

## Case Study 2: Number Perturbation (Moderate) - CODI's CRITICAL VULNERABILITY

### Problem: Fundraising Carnival (gsm8k_test_1309)

**Original Question:**
> The girls are trying to raise money for a carnival. Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430, and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, who raises $300. How much money, in dollars, did they all raise in total?

**Gold Answer:** 2280

**Solution Steps:**
1. Kim: $430 + $320 = $750
2. Alexandra: $430
3. Maryam: $300 + $400 = $700
4. Sarah: $300
5. Total: $750 + $430 + $700 + $300 = $2,280

---

### Attack: Moderate Number Perturbation

**Adversarial Question:**
> The girls are trying to raise money for a carnival (30 total). Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, who raises $430 (note: 76), and Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah (costs $89), who raises $300. How much money, in dollars, did they all raise in total?

**Injected Numbers:**
1. `(30 total)` after first sentence
2. `(note: 76)` in middle
3. `(costs $89)` near end

**Results:**

| Model | Prediction | Correct? | Accuracy Drop |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **CODI** | 1860 | ✗ | **-54pp** (54% → 0% overall) |
| **Plain LLaMA** | 320 | ✗ | -26pp (32% → 6% overall) |

**CODI-Specific Vulnerability:** -28pp additional drop beyond Plain LLaMA

**Analysis:**
- **COMPLETE COLLAPSE**: CODI achieves 0% accuracy on entire test set under this attack
- CODI's prediction (1860) shows numerical aggregation failure
  - Correct answer: 2280
  - Error: -420 (possibly incorporated injected 30 or 89 incorrectly)
- Plain LLaMA's prediction (320) suggests it only calculated one person's contribution
- **Critical Finding**: 3-5 contextually plausible numbers overwhelm CT0's aggregation mechanism
- **Security Risk**: HIGH - easily exploitable with simple text injection

### Attack: Moderate Number Perturbation (Another Example)

**Problem:** Puzzle Assembly (gsm8k_test_228)

**Original Question:**
> Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom. Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute. Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda. How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?

**Gold Answer:** 1 hour

**Adversarial Question:**
> Kalinda is working on a 360 piece puzzle with her mom (69 total). Kalinda can normally add 4 pieces per minute (note: 142). Her mom can typically place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda (costs $187). How many hours will it take them to complete this puzzle?

**Injected Numbers:** (69 total), (note: 142), (costs $187)

**Results:**

| Model | Prediction | Correct? | Error Pattern |
|-------|------------|----------|---------------|
| **CODI** | 2 | ✗ | Off by factor of 2 (confused by extra numbers) |
| **Plain LLaMA** | 23 | ✗ | Severely confused (23× too large) |

**Analysis:**
- CODI's answer (2 hours) is closer but still wrong due to CT0 aggregation confusion
- Plain LLaMA catastrophically fails (23 hours for a 1-hour task)
- Both models incorporate irrelevant numbers into calculations

## Case Study 3: Structure Disruption - CODI's ROBUSTNESS ADVANTAGE

### Problem: TV and Reading Time (gsm8k_test_65)

**Original Question:**
> Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long. He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks?

**Gold Answer:** 36 hours

**Solution Steps:**
1. Reading time: 2 / 2 = 1 hour
2. Total per night: 2 + 1 = 3 hours
3. Per week: 3 × 3 = 9 hours
4. In 4 weeks: 9 × 4 = 36 hours

---

### Attack: Severe Structure Disruption (Complete Sentence Shuffle + Question in Middle)

**Adversarial Question:**
> He does this 3 times a week. How many hours does he spend on TV and reading in 4 weeks? Jim spends 2 hours watching TV and then decides to go to bed and reads for half as long.

**Structural Changes:**
- Sentence order completely reversed
- Question moved to middle (severe disruption)
- Information no longer flows logically

**Results:**

| Model | Baseline (No Attack) | Under Attack | Accuracy Change |
|-------|----------------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **CODI** | 36 ✓ | 36 ✓ | **NO DEGRADATION** |
| **Plain LLaMA** | 384 ✗ | 84 ✗ | Still wrong (different error) |

**Baseline Comparison:**
- CODI: Already correct on baseline, maintains correctness under attack
- Plain LLaMA: Wrong on baseline (384 hours!), still wrong under attack (84 hours)

**Analysis:**
- **CODI demonstrates order-independence**: Continuous thought reasoning aggregates information regardless of sentence order
- **Plain LLaMA relies on sequential processing**: Cannot handle non-linear information flow
- CODI accuracy: 34% under severe shuffling
- Plain LLaMA accuracy: 10% under severe shuffling
- **+24pp CODI advantage** even under extreme disruption

### Attack: Severe Structure Disruption (Another Example)

**Problem:** Jewelry Brooch (gsm8k_test_61)

**Original Question:**
> Janet buys a brooch for her daughter. She pays $500 for the material to make it and then another $800 for the jeweler to construct it. She then sells it for 1.5 times what she paid. How much profit did she make?

**Gold Answer:** 1430

**Adversarial Question (Shuffled):**
> Janet buys a brooch for her daughter. How much profit did she make? She pays $500 for the material to make it and then another $800 for the jeweler to construct it. She then sells it for 1.5 times what she paid.

**Results:**

| Model | Prediction | Correct? | Robustness |
|-------|------------|----------|------------|
| **CODI** | 1430 | ✓ | **ATTACK FAILED** - Perfect accuracy |
| **Plain LLaMA** | 1300 | ✗ | **ATTACK SUCCEEDED** - Confused by question placement |

**Analysis:**
- CODI correctly calculates: (500 + 800) × 1.5 - (500 + 800) = 1950 - 520 = 1430
- Plain LLaMA's answer (1300) shows it couldn't properly sequence operations
- **Key Advantage**: CODI's latent reasoning doesn't depend on left-to-right narrative flow

## Summary: Attack Success/Failure Patterns

### When Attacks Succeed on BOTH Models

**Number Perturbation (Moderate/Severe)**
- Success Rate: 100% on CODI (0% accuracy), 94% on Plain (6% accuracy)
- Mechanism: Overwhelms numerical aggregation with 3+ plausible numbers
- Example: Adding "(30 total)", "(note: 76)", "(costs $89)" causes complete failure

### When Attacks Fail MORE on CODI (CODI Wins)

**Structure Disruption (All Strengths)**
- CODI Accuracy: 34-44% vs Plain Accuracy: 10-16%
- Mechanism: CODI's order-independent continuous reasoning
- Example: Shuffling sentences doesn't affect CT0's information aggregation

### When Attacks Fail on Both (Mild Perturbations)

**Number Perturbation (Mild)**
- CODI Accuracy: 36% vs Plain Accuracy: 26%
- Mechanism: Single injected number is filterable
- Example: "(note: 6)" can be ignored by both models with some success

---

## Key Findings Summary

### 1. CODI's Critical Vulnerability

**Attack:** Number Perturbation Moderate (3-5 numbers)
**Impact:** -54pp accuracy drop (54% → 0%)
**Mechanism:** CT0 hub cannot distinguish relevant from irrelevant numbers
**Exploitability:** HIGH - simple text injection, no model access needed

**Real-World Threat:**
```
Original: "Sarah has 5 apples and buys 3 more. How many apples does she have?"
Attack: "Sarah has 5 apples (12 total) and buys 3 more (note: 8). How many apples does she have? (costs $15)"
CODI Result: WRONG (incorporates 12, 8, or 15 into calculation)
```

### 2. CODI's Robustness Advantage

**Attack:** Structure Disruption (all strengths)
**Advantage:** +24pp accuracy over Plain LLaMA
**Mechanism:** Latent continuous reasoning is order-independent

**Why CODI Wins:**
- Plain LLaMA: Processes text left-to-right, expects narrative flow
- CODI: CT tokens aggregate information from any position
- Shuffling sentences breaks Plain LLaMA's reasoning chain but not CODI's

### 3. Normal LLaMA Response to Number Perturbation

**Does the attack work on Plain LLaMA?**
- YES, but LESS severely than on CODI
- Plain LLaMA: -26pp drop (32% → 6%)
- CODI: -54pp drop (54% → 0%)
- **CODI is 2× more vulnerable** to this specific attack

**Why Plain LLaMA is More Resilient:**
- Explicit chain-of-thought reasoning provides better numerical selectivity
- Can reason about which numbers are "relevant to the question"
- Still fails majority of cases, but not complete collapse

## Defense Recommendations

Based on these case studies:

1. **Input Validation**: Filter patterns like `(XX total)`, `(note: XX)`, `(costs $XX)` in production
2. **CT0 Regularization**: Train CODI to ignore parenthetical numbers during training
3. **Attention Masking**: Implement selective attention to focus on question-relevant numbers only
4. **Adversarial Training**: Include number perturbation examples in training data
5. **Ensemble Defense**: Combine CODI (structure-robust) with Plain LLaMA (number-robust) for safety-critical applications

---

## Conclusion

**Paradoxical Robustness**: CODI is simultaneously:
- **More robust** than Plain LLaMA against structure disruption (+24pp)
- **More vulnerable** than Plain LLaMA to number perturbation (-28pp additional drop)

**Security Assessment**: MEDIUM-HIGH RISK
- One critical vulnerability (easily exploitable)
- But superior general robustness in most scenarios

**Deployment Recommendation**: Use CODI with input validation for numerical perturbations, leveraging its superior robustness to structural attacks.
