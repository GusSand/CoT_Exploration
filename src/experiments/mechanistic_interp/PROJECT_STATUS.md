# Mechanistic Interpretability - Project Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26
**Status:** MECH-02 Complete, Paused pending better SAE model

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed MECH-02 (Step Importance Analysis), discovering that continuous thoughts use **progressive refinement** rather than "planning first" strategy. Late positions (4,5) are most critical, with position 5 showing 86.8% importance. Work is now **paused** pending availability of improved SAE model for feature extraction.

## Pending Experiments

### ⏸️ MECH-03: Feature Extraction (Blocked - Awaiting Better SAE)

**Objective:** Extract interpretable features from continuous thoughts using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)

**Current Blocker:** SAE model quality
- Current SAE trained on 800 problems (baseline)
- New SAE being developed with improved architecture/training
- Position 0 EV: 37.4% (baseline) → 70.5% (full dataset)
- Waiting for next iteration of SAE model before proceeding

**Planned Approach:**
1. Load improved SAE model
2. Extract 2048 features per position (6 positions × 2048 = 12,288 features)
3. Focus on position 5 (most important per MECH-02)
4. Compare feature activation patterns across positions
5. Identify "commitment features" vs "exploration features"

**Expected Timeline:** TBD (depends on SAE availability)

**Dependencies:**
- Improved SAE model (waiting)
- MECH-02 results (complete ✅)

---

### ⏸️ MECH-04: Feature-Correctness Correlation (Waiting on MECH-03)

**Objective:** Identify which SAE features correlate with answer correctness

**Planned Approach:**
1. For each feature: measure activation on correct vs incorrect problems
2. Rank features by discriminative power
3. Validate position 5 features are most discriminative (hypothesis from MECH-02)
4. Identify "error-predicting features"

**Expected Findings (Based on MECH-02):**
- Position 5 features should show strongest correlations
- Early position features (0-2) may show weaker correlations
- Should identify features that predict reasoning errors

**Dependencies:**
- MECH-03 complete (blocked)
- SAE feature extraction (blocked)

---

### ⏸️ MECH-06: Intervention Framework (Waiting on MECH-04)

**Objective:** Test causal interventions on continuous thoughts

**Planned Experiments:**
1. **Late-stage steering** (hypothesis: position 4-5 interventions most effective)
2. **Feature ablation** (remove specific features, measure impact)
3. **Feature enhancement** (amplify features, test effect on correctness)
4. **Position swapping** (swap early/late positions, test robustness)

**Expected Findings (Based on MECH-02):**
- Position 5 interventions should affect 87% of problems
- Position 1 interventions should affect only 14% of problems
- Late-stage steering should be more effective than early-stage

**Dependencies:**
- MECH-04 complete (blocked)
- Feature importance rankings (blocked)

## Infrastructure & Reusable Code

### CODIInterface (`utils/codi_interface.py`)

**Purpose:** Clean interface for loading CODI and extracting continuous thoughts

**Key Classes:**
- `CODIInterface`: Load model, generate answers, extract continuous thoughts
- `StepImportanceMeasurer`: Position-wise ablation using forward hooks

**Usage:**
```python
from codi_interface import CODIInterface, StepImportanceMeasurer

# Load CODI
interface = CODIInterface('~/codi_ckpt/llama_gsm8k')

# Extract continuous thoughts
thoughts = interface.extract_continuous_thoughts("What is 2+2?", layer_idx=8)
# Returns: List[Tensor(1, 2048)] - 6 positions

# Generate answer
answer = interface.generate_answer("What is 2+2?")

# Measure step importance
measurer = StepImportanceMeasurer(interface, layer_idx=8)
result = measurer.measure_position_importance("What is 2+2?", position=3)
```

**Code Reuse:** 90% adapted from existing experiments
- `ActivationCacherLLaMA` pattern for model loading
- `NTokenPatcher` pattern for forward hooks
- Answer generation from `patch_and_eval_llama.py`

## Key Insights for Future Work

### From MECH-02: Progressive Refinement Strategy

**Finding:** Late positions (4,5) most critical, not early positions

**Implications:**

1. **Feature Extraction (MECH-03):**
   - Prioritize position 5 SAE features
   - Hypothesis: Position 5 features encode "commitment" decisions
   - Hypothesis: Position 0-2 features encode "exploration" strategies

2. **Correlation Analysis (MECH-04):**
   - Position 5 features should show strongest correlations with correctness
   - Look for "decision features" at late positions
   - Look for "exploration features" at early positions

3. **Intervention Framework (MECH-06):**
   - Late-stage interventions (position 4-5) should be most effective
   - Test "steering" by amplifying/suppressing position 5 features
   - Early-stage interventions may be ineffective (model can recover)

### Comparison to Explicit CoT

**Explicit CoT:** "If step 1 is wrong, everything fails" (error propagation)

**Continuous CoT (CODI):** "Early errors recoverable, late errors fatal" (progressive refinement)

**Key Difference:** Robustness to early errors, sensitivity to late errors

## Decision Points

### Why Pause After MECH-02?

**Reason:** SAE model quality is critical for feature extraction

**Current SAE Status:**
- Baseline (800 problems): Position 0 at 37.4% EV (FAIL)
- Full dataset (7,473 problems): Position 0 at 70.5% EV (PASS)
- Further improvements in progress

**Rationale for Waiting:**
- Better SAE = more interpretable features
- Better SAE = more reliable correlations (MECH-04)
- Better SAE = more effective interventions (MECH-06)
- Low-quality SAE risks invalidating downstream experiments

**When to Resume:**
- New SAE model available with improved metrics
- All positions achieve ≥70% explained variance
- Feature death rate <30% across all positions

---

## Reproducibility

### Running MECH-02

```bash
cd /home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration/src/experiments/mechanistic_interp/scripts
export PYTHONPATH=/home/paperspace/dev/CoT_Exploration/codi:$PYTHONPATH
python 02_measure_step_importance.py
```

**Expected Output:**
- Validation on 87 problems (~2.5 min)
- Full sweep on 1,000 problems (~46 min)
- Results saved to `../data/step_importance_*.json`

**Configuration:**
- Model: LLaMA-3.2-1B-Instruct with CODI (6 latent tokens)
- Intervention: Layer 8 (50% through model)
- Methodology: Position-wise zeroing via forward hooks
- Metric: Binary importance (correct/incorrect)

---

## Next Steps (When Resuming)

### Immediate Actions:

1. **Validate New SAE Model:**
   - Check explained variance (target: ≥70% all positions)
   - Check feature death rate (target: <30%)
   - Validate interpretability of key features

2. **Update Dependencies:**
   - Update `codi_interface.py` to load new SAE model
   - Test SAE integration with CODI interface
   - Verify feature extraction works correctly

3. **Begin MECH-03:**
   - Extract features for 1,000 test problems
   - Focus on position 5 first (most important)
   - Identify top features by activation frequency

### Follow-up Sequence:

```
MECH-03 (Feature Extraction)
    ↓
MECH-04 (Correlation Analysis)
    ↓
MECH-06 (Intervention Framework)
    ↓
Final Report & Publication
```

**Estimated Total Time (After Resume):** 6-8 hours of computation + 2-3 hours documentation
